<br />EXT. JIMMY'S CHILDHOOD HOME - DAY - 1995
<br />
<br />Summer/Spring day. The house is regular; no memorable embellishments making it stand out in the street. The grass out the front is green and well cut with a path running down the middle of the lawn to the front door and veranda.
<br />
<br />A car arrives outside the front and parks. In the background is the regular chime of outer city-suburban noises; cars off in the distance; ice cream trucks; lawnmowers; kids playing and; dogs barking.
<br />
<br />ELLIS REDDING arrives and parks the car at the front of the house. He's dressed as you would imagine a well to do lawyer is; clean-cut, well shaved, expensive suit and an imaginary string attached to the top of his head making him walk tall and proud, oozing confidence.
<br />
<br />Ellis remains seated in his car a moment. He looks at a piece of paper in his hand and compares the address written on it with the number on the postbox of the house.
<br />
<br />He lights a cigarette and gets out the car. He closes the drivers door and leans on the car for a moment while he scans the street.
<br />
<br />There are kids playing further down the street and a man across the street watering his garden.
<br />
<br />He takes off his wedding ring and puts it in his pocket.
<br />
<br />There is a laking tap on the front lawn of the house he is at. He takes off his jacket, places it on the roof of the car, and walks towards the tap.
<br />
<br />He bends down onto his haunches and fixes the leak.
<br />
<br />As he looks up he sees a young boy run away from the window of the house he is at.
<br />
<br />Ellis smiles. He then walks back to the car and puts his jacket back on. He reaches inside the open window to pick up a briefcase, the kind you would find in an antique store.
<br />
<br />He proceeds to walk to the front door and ring the doorbell.
<br />
<br />JIMMY'S DAD answers.
<br />
<br />Jimmy's Dad is of a slender build. He's got long hair and an unshaven face. He has a suspicious look about him. He's wearing a wife beater and blue jeans.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY'S DAD
<br />    Af't noon. What can I do for you?
<br />        (He is in a good mood, this is for no immediately obvious reason.)
<br />
<br />ELLIS is a rather cold character - expressionless. Professional. He has a 1960's gangster presence that startles most who come into contact with him. He is of about mid-'40s in age at this point in time.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    Mr Ricard, I'm here acting as the legal representative for Damian Spink. I believe you have commercial attachments with Mr Spink.
<br />
<br />The camera changes so that it is looking at the doorway from behind Jimmy's Dad, it sees that he is holding a revolver in his hand behind the door.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY'S DAD
<br />    Yes.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    As much as I'm sure you are enjoying this lovely weather we have been gifted with today, I am afraid that these proceedings would be better suited to four walls and chilling refreshments at a table. Seeing as it is your house, I'm leaving it to you to lead these proceedings somewhere more appropriate.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY'S DAD
<br />    Yes. Of course.
<br />
<br />Jimmy's Dad makes a motioning gesture to come inside.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY'S DAD (CONT'D)
<br />    Please.
<br />INT. JIMMY'S CHILDHOOD HOME - DAY
<br />
<br />The pair walk through. The camera follows the pair and does not cut as they walk down the hallway into a dining area. The home is of humble appearance and again is ordinary and regular.
<br />
<br />Jimmy's Dad tucks the revolver into the back of his belt as he walks behind Ellis Redding. The two sit at either end of a six-seated table. Ellis is meticulous in his placement of the briefcase, positioning it perfectly between the two of them. Jimmy's Dad begins to rise.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY'S DAD
<br />    You wanna coffee or tea or anything?
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    I'm fine with water. The rocks would be sublime if they're handy.
<br />
<br />Jimmy's Dad pulls out glasses and starts pouring.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY'S DAD
<br />    Tell me... Mr?
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    Redding.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY'S DAD
<br />        (Smiles)
<br />    Redding. What is it exactly that you do?
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    Well, I'm a solicitor, Mr Ricard. My firm represents Spinks Propriety Limited in its commercial activities.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY'S DAD
<br />    Right, and what's that got to do with me?
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    Well, as I have come to understand you have been in business with Mr Spink quite sometime now, manufacturing his product, seeing everything is functioning as it should. Am I correct?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY'S DAD
<br />    Yeah, I deliver human growth hormone for his fighters. He keeps the greenbacks coming.
<br />
<br />Ellis opens the briefcase so as to not reveal its contents to either Mr Ricard or the camera. Pulls out a leather bound book and pen and opens. Whilst he does this, Jimmy's Dad arrives back at the table with the glass of water for Ellis, without ice.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    Yes!
<br />
<br />Ellis sees that there is no ice and shows slight disapointment.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING (CONT'D)
<br />    Now that is exactly why I am here. As I see it, you have failed to deliver your end of the deal for the past three months.
<br />
<br />Ellis takes a sip of the water. He is pleased by the taste.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING (CONT'D)
<br />    Mm Mm Mm, this is some tasty water, is this town or tank?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY'S DAD
<br />    Tank. What were you saying about my business?
<br />
<br />Jimmy's Dad stands up straight and folds his arms.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    Fluoride really takes away the beautiful taste of water... I've been meaning to go onto tank water but my wife is a dentist so she hates the idea.
<br />
<br />Ellis takes another sip and looks to Jimmy's Dad. Jimmy's Dad is still waiting in suspense.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING (CONT'D)
<br />    Oh! Sorry! Where was I?
<br />        (Looks at his notes)
<br />    Ah Yes! As a result of you not getting the steroids, Spinks' business has not been able to function at the same success rate.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY'S DAD
<br />    Yeah, I talked to Spinks about that, he understands. Told me he wouldn't throw in as many fighters while the steroids were scarce. I can only make it as fast as the ingredients come. We had shortages and delays but I'll get
<br />
<br />                JIMMY'S DAD (CONT'D)
<br />    him what we have contracted for as promised. The guy who gets the fucking HGH for me was shot on his regular route. The fuck I'm supposed to do about it?
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    As much as I would like to sympathise with that, I will retain a more professional attitude. I'm afraid to inform you that Spinks has come to a new understanding regarding your failure to deliver.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY'S DAD
<br />        (Slightly Sarcastically)
<br />    What the fuck is that supposed to mean? I'll get the fucking juice over when I get it over.
<br />
<br />Pause.
<br />
<br />Ellis looks over at Jimmy's Dad with a piercing gaze. The struggle for who has the most power is settled as Ellis gains control of the situation.
<br />
<br />Jimmy's Dad shrinks back into his chair the way a dog would back into his doghouse.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    Look, I can't provide any assistance to you as to the past and the failings to uphold the contract on your part. Spinks has elected to terminate the contract as a result of your breach. Because of this you owe him the damages to which he is rightfully entitled.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY'S DAD
<br />    Fuck off. What fucking damages?
<br />
<br />Jimmy's Dad stands up out of his chair and pulls out the revolver from his belt and holds it so that Ellis can see it in his hand.
<br />
<br />He does not point the gun, he only means to threaten Ellis with it.
<br />
<br />
<br />                JIMMY'S DAD (CONT'D)
<br />    I've done all that I can do. I'm sick of taking this shit. I get him the best HGH money can buy and this is how he treats me.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    Mr Ricard, as much as I'm sure you love having the power in these proceedings, I find it appropriate and more professional to lower the hostility.
<br />
<br />Jimmy's Dad starts doing a Robert De Niro "you talking to me?" gesture as he looks left to right while saying the following line.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY'S DAD
<br />    Wow, you got some fucking balls walking into my house like this, I should fucking kill you right now.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />        (Slight chuckle; calm; confident)
<br />    I'm just the messenger Mr Ricard.
<br />
<br />Pause.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING (CONT'D)
<br />    You're not going to shoot me. You're a reasonable and rational man, I am sure you are well aware of the likely consequences of killing me. So please, allow us to continue.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY'S DAD
<br />    Okay, but if I don't like what I hear, this isn't gonna end well.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />        (Laughing)
<br />    I'm sure it won't.
<br />
<br />Jimmy's Dad sits down and aims the gun at Ellis. Ellis' expression turns cold in response but decides to continue as planned.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    Let me explain the issue Spinks has and what he's employed me to handle. See, his initial success rate in the
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING (CONT'D)
<br />    fights was sitting at 78%, since your breach that number has dropped considerably to 54%. Taking into consideration the average bet is $35 plus change, with roughly 78 bets per fight, it was likely that an estimated $4,596.78 would have profited. Now since this was a mere estimate we will give or take $100. Spinks' total profit from the past three months was only $1,978, so you're looking at a total cost of...
<br />
<br />Uses a calculator and pauses.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING (CONT'D)
<br />    $2,618... Give or take a $100.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY'S DAD
<br />        (Smiling)
<br />    And I'm supposed to fucking pay that?
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    Well... Yes, you are. But please continue listening.
<br />
<br />Jimmy's Dad reclines to a more comfortable seating position in the chair across the table from Ellis Redding.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING (CONT'D)
<br />    Now, it has come to our attention you've sent our dear friend Mr Mogul a letter.
<br />
<br />Jimmy's Dad has a look of surprise on his face, trying to make it uncertain as to whether he did.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING (CONT'D)
<br />    Right, just as we thought. Now the contents of this letter was regarding the use of the high performing HGH in your employer's fighters.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY'S DAD
<br />    Yes, you know what I did do that. I Did it for a fuck tonne o' money too.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    I see. You are aware that Mogul is a competitor of your employer?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY'S DAD
<br />    Completely.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    I see.
<br />
<br />Ellis writes something down on a notepad he pulls out, finishes writing and continues.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING (CONT'D)
<br />    And you are aware that by revealing this information to our competitor you again breached clause...
<br />
<br />Ellis looks at his notes.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING (CONT'D)
<br />    14 of your contract. And in the case of a breach of this kind, you agreed to clause 22, which makes it clear that you owe a punitive fee of...
<br />
<br />Ellis checks his notes again.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING (CONT'D)
<br />    $80,000 to Mr Spinks.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY'S DAD
<br />        (Smiling)
<br />    Woah, I agreed to this?
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    Yes, I believe so. This is your signature is it not?
<br />
<br />Ellis holds up the original contract pointing to Jimmy's Dad's signature.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY'S DAD
<br />    Okay. I'm afraid I'm not liking where this is going so much Mr Redding.
<br />
<br />Ellis Redding nods in response.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    Ah! See I thought you would say that, so I consulted with Mr Spinks in regards to any alternative dispute resolutions and he came to agree to an alternative option for you.
<br />
<br />Jimmy's Dad reclines in his chair once more and smiles as he knows the alternative is his death, but he plans on killing Redding first.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY'S DAD
<br />    You're gonna fucking kill me?
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    Well hold on.
<br />        (He says in a joking manner)
<br />    Let me explain.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY'S DAD
<br />    Do go on.
<br />Ellis lights up a cigarette, and glazes over as he stares out the window.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    Are you familiar with the works of Plato? or perhaps Shakespeare?
<br />
<br />Jimmy's Dad shakes his head.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING (CONT'D)
<br />    Okay. Well let us imagine a cave in which there are three prisoners. The prisoners are tied to some rocks, their arms and legs are bound and their head is tied so that they cannot look at anything but the stonewall in front of them. These prisoners have been here since birth and have never seen outside of the cave. Behind the prisoners is a fire, and between them is a raised walkway. People outside the cave walk along this walkway carrying things on their head including; animals, plants, wood and stone. This then casts shadows onto the wall in front of these prisoners. When people walk along the walkway, you can see shadows of the objects they are carrying cast on to the wall. If you had never seen the real objects ever before, you would believe that the shadows of objects were ‘real.’ So what does this all mean? Well allow Plato to explain. The cave represents people who believe that knowledge comes from what we see and hear in the
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING (CONT'D)
<br />    world – empirical evidence. The cave shows that believers of empirical knowledge are trapped in a ‘cave’ of misunderstanding. The Shadows represent the perceptions of those who believe empirical evidence ensures knowledge. If you believe that what you see should be taken as truth, then you are merely seeing a shadow of the truth. Now, why am I telling you this? Well, I am the enlightened prisoner who managed to escape this prison and venture into the enlightened to see the inanimate objects casting the shadows were, in fact, not real. You are still imprisoned in the cave.
<br />
<br />Ellis sees that Jimmy's Dad is confused by this statement. He opens his briefcase and the contents of it are seen by the camera, in it contains a swan-off shotgun.
<br />
<br />Ellis picks up the armed weapon and points it at Jimmy's Dad through the suitcase so as to not reveal the existence of the weapon to the target.
<br />
<br />Camera begins to zoom into Redding's face slowly throughout the rest of his monologue.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING (CONT'D)
<br />    What I'm saying is this, humanity is the source of our problems. Our forebears collectively decided however, over the sands of time, that it is too objectionable to kill the source of the problem. Hitler tried to kill the source of his problem, but the world told him he was wrong. I'm saying he was justified in his actions, the solution is always to terminate the cause of your problems, in his case, the Jews. Now I don't necessarily agree with Hitler's actions as I don't think Jews were the problem; nonetheless, he was on the right track. We have allowed religion and morality to supersede this. When you find a rat in the kitchen and you kill it you don't then congratulate yourself for dealing with a rat problem, you then go on a rat killing
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING (CONT'D)
<br />    spree and kill the problem at its source...
<br />Ellis stubs out his cigarette on the coffee table.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING (CONT'D)
<br />    The existence of the rat. Now see here, there are problems at hand, and as a lawyer my employment in this company is purely for the purpose of solving these problems. So I pose to you the question; would you rather pay the large amount of money that would send you into financial ruin - it would probably put you and your family onto the streets, I'm told you have an infant son - or you can assist me in addressing the source of all these problems at hand.
<br />Out of debt, fear and a desire to deal with the situation, misunderstanding the consequences, Jimmy's dad says what sounds right.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY'S DAD
<br />    Let's just solve the fucking problem then.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    Ah, well that makes my job a lot more simple and cures the need for paperwork.
<br />
<br />Ellis Redding fires the shotgun, shooting through the briefcase, killing Jimmy's Dad immediately. He then follows to pack his suitcase as the camera shows a wide shot of the table showing the dead body at one end and Ellis at the other.
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />INT. JIMMY'S HOUSE - MORNING - PRESENT DAY
<br />
<br />Jimmy's apartment is seen as the camera looks out into the living room from behind the kitchen bench. Jimmy enters on to the screen from the right with a cup of coffee in one hand and sits down at the kitchen bench.
<br />
<br />He is a quaint figure, ordinary, there is nothing to suggest that he would amount to much. He is slender but not overly athletic in appearance. He is wearing a navy blue polo shirt tucked into black pants.
<br />
<br />He is alone, the camera slowly zooms into his face as he does nothing but drink the coffee.
<br />
<br />After a few seconds, the camera cuts to the cup of coffee and sees Jimmy open a small bottle of Jim Beam and pour it into his coffee. He is quite generous with the amount he pours in. He continues to finish the remaining coffee quickly and gets up and exits the frame to the left.
<br />
<br />INT./EXT. CAR - MORNING - MOVING - SAME DAY
<br />
<br />The camera cuts to the passenger seat of his car and sees Jimmy open the door, get in and start the car (he doesn't put the seat belt on). Camera cuts to outside the car. He drives off.
<br />
<br />Jimmy continues to swig the bottle of Jim Beam continuously throughout the car ride. The camera stays on an extreme closeup of his face for thirty seconds, Jimmy showing no emotion appearing at all, a blank canvas waiting to be painted on.
<br />
<br />He turns on the radio and tunes it to the station 94.2 FM - The Trend. Not loud enough to entertain, just to replace the silence.

<br />    Hows-it-gawn Jackie.
<br />
<br />Jimmy uses his knees to steer as he lights a cigarette. He holds the cigarette in his mouth, places one hand on the steering wheel and then uses his other hand to take another swig of whiskey.
<br />
<br />                SHOW HOST #1
<br />    Pretty good Jimmy. You know I was reading this news article last night about how Australia has one of the happiest working forces in the world.
<br />
<br />The small bottle is now empty, Jimmy looks at it and throws it onto the back seat.
<br />
<br />                SHOW HOST #2
<br />    And how's that Jack?
<br />
<br />Jimmy stops at a red light.
<br />
<br />                SHOW HOST #1
<br />    Well, a new report shows that in a recently conducted survey, 95% of Australians enjoy their work, and of that 95%, 29% love their work.
<br />
<br />Jimmy begins to observe a homeless man begging for change on the street while the radio hosts continue to talk.
<br />
<br />                SHOW HOST #3
<br />    I always under the impression we weren't supposed to like our work.
<br />
<br />All three laugh obnoxiously as if the joke was actually funny.
<br />
<br />                SHOW HOST #1
<br />    Well apparently majority of the country didn't quite get the memo. This report also went on to say that
<br />
<br />                SHOW HOST #1 (CONT'D)
<br />    for those who don't enjoy their job, it is usually as a result of poor working environment. Which is obvious if you ask me!
<br />
<br />They all laugh obnoxiously again. A man in a suit walks up to the homeless man and gives him change.
<br />
<br />                SHOW HOST #2
<br />    I reckon, for that five percent, they just need to walk into their boss's office and set it straight, set it right!
<br />
<br />Jimmy smiles in response to the radio as he turns it off. Light goes green and Jimmy continues driving.
<br />
<br />INT. WAREHOUSE - MORNING - SAME DAY
<br />
<br />Jimmy and his coworkers, Sean and Klaus, are unloading wood onto a cart in the main section of the warehouse. Jimmy is now wearing a workplace apron over his clothes.
<br />
<br />There are constant loud noises in the background as it is a warehouse. A nearby staircase leads to an office and with a window overlooking the whole warehouse - this is the office of Jimmy's boss.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />        (Looking towards the office, said in a joking manner.)
<br />    Ya know what? I reckon he's sucked some pretty large dicks in his day to earn that little nest he's perched up in. Someone ought to punch that smug look off his face and teach him some humility.
<br />
<br />                SEAN
<br />        (Laughing)
<br />    Far out! Y'know what, I think you're right, go up there and show him how a man really sucks a dick.
<br />All three laugh.
<br />
<br />                KLAUS
<br />    It does make you think though? How some people make it up the fucking corporate ladder as if they had
<br />
<br />                KLAUS (CONT'D)
<br />    explosives kiestered up their ass.
<br />
<br />                SEAN
<br />    He's a fucking thief, that's how.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />        (Laughs)
<br />    What do you mean he's a thief?
<br />
<br />                SEAN
<br />    You know your super? How much you reckon you have?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    No clue.
<br />
<br />                SEAN
<br />    And how long you been working here?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Six odd maybe, could even six and a half by now.
<br />
<br />                SEAN
<br />    Well your super is drying up with that man in control of it.
<br />        (Pointing to the office)
<br />    I reckon he takes that 9 percent and disperses a little here and there. Keeping the profit.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    What do you mean?
<br />
<br />                SEAN
<br />    I talked to me wife, she's with the same super fund, I earn more than her, she's coming off with a much nicer profit at the end of each year on top of the money she makes. Why's that?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Why?
<br />
<br />                SEAN
<br />    Cause that fat fuck up there I reckon is takin our super money, investing it in his own shitty fund and what not, and only placing the money we make in our fund at the end of each year once
<br />
<br />                SEAN (CONT'D)
<br />    he's made is biscuit, robbing us of all the money we would have made during the year in our funds.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Okay, if you've figured that out why haven't you brought it up at all?
<br />
<br />                KLAUS
<br />    I'm confused, how has he stolen money then?
<br />
<br />                SEAN
<br />        (to Klaus, laughing)
<br />    Had you finished high school you might understand.
<br />
<br />Jimmy and Sean laugh at Klaus's dispense.
<br />
<br />                SEAN (CONT'D)
<br />        (Answering Jimmy)
<br />    Only fucking hit me last night when my wife wanted some bullshit accountant to come over to handle some things. Told me my super is looking shy. Plus you can't prove it, we signed some bullshit waiver saying our super would be placed in at the end of each year in one big payment.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    So how much you reckon he's makin' off our money if it's true?
<br />
<br />                SEAN
<br />    I don't fucking know, but he's getting nine percent of everyone's salary each year to invest in his own portfolio, and he keeps the profit.
<br />
<br />Jimmy's boss walks out the door of his office and looks over the warehouse.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />        (Looking up at the boss)
<br />    So we can't prove it?
<br />
<br />                SEAN
<br />    No fucking way it seems. And with that kinda beautiful corruption, you're
<br />
<br />                SEAN (CONT'D)
<br />    bound to be a success. Money takes you places a friendly face and a firm handshake can't.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    So if you can't prove it, how then, tell me, did you come up with this elaborate idea about our boss swindling us of our interest?
<br />
<br />                SEAN
<br />    I used to do it myself, trade secrets. Sometimes, cutting the corners is the quickest way to the top.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />        (Chuckles at the remark)
<br />    I reckon crime can dig you out of any hole. Like you said, it's just cutting corners.
<br />
<br />                KLAUS
<br />    What's the point when all you have to do is cover up your crime though? That would be more back breaking work on top of this shit we already put up with.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    A perfect crime wouldn't need to be covered up, a perfect crime is done in the dark, it's already under the covers.
<br />
<br />                KLAUS
<br />    I don't see the gain to be frank.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Well, each to their own I guess. I know I probably won't take this shit forever though. You get to the point where your life is just what you do between the hours of nine and five, I was hoping I'd reach that point at 50, heck maybe even 60. Looks like I hit it far too early.
<br />
<br />                SEAN
<br />    Yeah, wathcya gonna do bout it then?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Fucking no clue. Get a new job? I dunno, either it's get busy living, or get busy dying.
<br />
<br />Jimmy looks up at his boss, the two of them lock into eye contact for a few moments before jimmy goes back to work.
<br />
<br />INT. JIMMY'S HOUSE - MORNING - FOLLOWING DAY
<br />
<br />Scene opens with the camera focusing on the bottle of Jim Bean in Jimmy's hand, he's rubbing the label with his thumb as he holds it showing he's thinking about his descent into alcoholism.
<br />
<br />As the frame widens it becomes visible that Jimmy is not wearing any clothing. There's a cup of coffee to the right, Jimmy looks at it for a moment then proceeds to stand up and put the whole cup down the sink.
<br />
<br />He opens the bottle of Whiskey and drinks a large amount of the whiskey. He finishes it and slightly stumbles as he screws the lid back on. He walks over into his bedroom to the closet; opens the closet and looks for a shirt.
<br />
<br />The rail on which his shirts hang is visibly broken at one end, as if Jimmy has attempted to hang himself and the rail broke off one end of the wall. Jimmy focuses on the broken part of the rail for a moment before picking up clothing and exiting.
<br />
<br />INT./EXT. CAR - MORNING - MOVING - SAME DAY
<br />
<br />Whilst driving the car silent this morning.
<br />
<br />Jimmy continues to drink from the same bottle of whiskey until the entire thing is finished, he throws it onto the back seat. The camera slowly zooms in on Jimmy's face. He is trying to keep concentrated on the road but his drunkenness is preventing exactly that.
<br />
<br />The revs of the car can be heard; they are increasing slowly. This continues until the camera is very closed in on his face. The camera cuts as in a rush the sound of brakes being applied is heard and there is the sound of a crash.
<br />
<br />Jimmy has crashed into a car after passing through a red light. He lifts his head up and there is visible blood on his forehead and his nose starts to bleed all over his shirt.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />        (Screams and hits the steering wheel)
<br />    Ah! Shit! Fuck!
<br />INT. POLICE QUESTIONING ROOM - MORNING - SAME DAY
<br />
<br />Jimmy is in remand after being apprehended by police for the car crash, he is charged with drunk driving. Jimmy is sitting in a the questioning room waiting. He is alone.
<br />
<br />The camera again zooms closer into him, emphasizing that he is alone not only physically but mentally. A police officer walks in.
<br />
<br />                CONSTABLE
<br />    Hey kid, your lawyer is here.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Lawyer?
<br />
<br />Ellis Redding walks in, he has aged slightly since we last saw him as 25 years has passed since the killing of Jimmy's father.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY (CONT'D)
<br />    You look more expensive then what the government dishes out.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />        (Smiling at the joke.)
<br />    Maybe I just like to dress nice.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    So how's it looking Mr...
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    Redding, but please, for you it can just be Ellis. And it's looking quite good, charges have been dropped and the DPP has agreed to not prosecute on any grounds, you're looking at a few demerit points on your license.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Strewth! That's it? Why'd the DPP drop the charges?
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />        (Smiling)
<br />    Sometimes fortune turns your way.
<br />EXT. THE BUSH - DAY
<br />
<br />Camera cuts to a scene where Ellis opens the boot of a car. The car is in bush land nowhere near anything.
<br />
<br />The character in the boot is the man pressing charges against Jimmy. Ellis begins to talk in this scene.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    It's nothing personal, I just can't have Jimmy in jail right now. It just so happens that you're the one pressing charges against him.
<br />
<br />Ellis begins stabbing the man in the boot as he makes muffled screams cause his mouth is covered.
<br />
<br />This is a homage to Goodfellas where Joe Pesci does something similar.
<br />
<br />INT. POLICE QUESTIONING ROOM - MORNING
<br />
<br />Scene resumes back to Jimmy and Ellis.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />        (Chuckles)
<br />    Well, can I walk free?
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    Well hold on, let's not give each other hand jobs just yet, I have one more thing I'd like to settle. See, I'm not a lawyer provided by the state, I'm a private lawyer. So you owe me a little money, but all I ask is a moment of your time and you can leave.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Private lawyer?
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    Yes. Private. Now, if you'll allow me.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Anything for the man who got me out of prison.
<br />
<br />There is a visible "no smoking" sign in the background, however, Ellis continues to pull out a cigarette and light it up, then offering one to Jimmy who gladly accepts and allows Ellis to light it.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    Jimmy, I believe I knew your father.
<br />
<br />Jimmy's curiosity is caught and he is visibly interested in what Ellis has to say.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING (CONT'D)
<br />    In fact, I was with him in his last moments.
<br />
<br />Jimmy knows that this means Ellis killed his father.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Ah, I see.
<br />        (Nodding)
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    You harbor no hatred for me?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Nope.
<br />
<br />The two them both take their time as they smoke, pausing for some time before Jimmy breaks the silence.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY (CONT'D)
<br />    You see, my father was two things to me; biological and absent. What my father did to deserve death, I don't know, frankly I don't care. But what I do know is he shat the bed a good degree. Sure enough, the government froze his assets and the insurance didn't come through because of his dodgy deals; we couldn't get a cent cause of him. My mum withered away in similar fashion shortly after.
<br />
<br />He puffs his cigarette. Looks Ellis directly into his eye.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY (CONT'D)
<br />    A boy turns into a man pretty fucking quick after something like that. I now know how invaluable life really is.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />        (Chuckles at the remark)
<br />    That mindset comes in handy in my line
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING (CONT'D)
<br />    of work.
<br />
<br />Pause. Both stare at each other.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    He killed himself and left us to clean up the mess. I don't hate you, in fact I applaud you for what you did. He was a dickhead who needed straightening up. I'm a better man without him.
<br />
<br />Pause.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    I told myself I would do this when I saw an infant, sitting happily on the couch, oblivious to what had just occurred only a few meters behind him. Now, I'm here in an attempt to give back to you what I took.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />        (Chuckles)
<br />    I don't need a father Mr Redding.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    That's not what I was offering.
<br />
<br />Jimmy looks up to Ellis, interested. Ellis waits a few seconds before continuing.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING (CONT'D)
<br />    I'm here to offer you a life of slightly more value than your current.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    And what makes you think I'm not content with my current one?
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    Well, the railing in your closet is an indication. You're letting your own employer steal from you. You like your coffee with milk, sugar and whiskey. Again... let me ask you why you're even sitting in this chair today.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />        (Surprised expression)
<br />    You went into my house?
<br />
<br />Ellis doesn't respond, instead he continues to smoke and wait until Jimmy answers his question.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY (CONT'D)
<br />    Why am I here?
<br />
<br />Ellis nods.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY (CONT'D)
<br />    A failed attempt.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />        (responding quickly)
<br />    At driving or or killing yourself?
<br />
<br />Jimmy doesn't respond. Pause.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING (CONT'D)
<br />    I believe you are aware of what I do. I'm offering an... internship.
<br />
<br />Jimmy doesn't respond. Ellis pulls out a handgun and places it on the table. Jimmy is shocked by its presence.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING (CONT'D)
<br />    Don't worry, they can't record us when we are in here, even if they do it's inadmissible in court.
<br />
<br />Jimmy relaxes in his chair at the sound of this information.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING (CONT'D)
<br />    You know what you want to do.
<br />        (Leans towards Jimmy)
<br />    So do it.
<br />
<br />Jimmy nods in response.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING (CONT'D)
<br />    Once you've done it, we will talk again.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    How will you know when I've done it?
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    The same way I knew the railing in your closet was broken.
<br />
<br />"Funky Suspense" by Bensound plays. Ellis stands up, puts his cigarette out on the table and begins to leaves the room.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING (CONT'D)
<br />        (Turns back to face Jimmy)
<br />    Take your life into your own hands.
<br />
<br />Ellis leaves. Jimmy sits in his chair starring at the gun for a few moment before getting up and putting it in the back of his pants.
<br />
<br />INT. POLICE STATION - MORNING
<br />
<br />He exits the room and the camera follows him (front facing) as he walks through police cubicles. Royce can be seen out of focus as Jimmy quickly walks by him.
<br />
<br />Royce is not supposed to be given any camera focus, he is supposed to look like an extra. This is just to illustrate how close the two stories are running parallel to each other.
<br />
<br />INT. JIMMY'S BOSS'S OFFICE - MORNING - SAME DAY
<br />
<br />Jimmy bursts through the office door into the office, closes it behind him and locks the door. There are loud noises coming from the warehouse.
<br />
<br />His shirt still has blood all over it from the car crash. HE walks right over to the desk where Jimmy's Boss, Dean, is seated. There is a window at the rear of the office spanning the width of the room.
<br />
<br />Dean's desk is in front of the window. Dean is facing away in his office chair as he begins talking.
<br />
<br />                DEAN
<br />    Can I help you?
<br />        (Turns around as he talks and sees the bloody shirt)
<br />    What the hell happened to you?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Revelation.
<br />        (He sits down in the a chair facing the desk)
<br />    What do I look like to you Dean?
<br />
<br />                DEAN
<br />    Excuse me?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Am I your wife?
<br />
<br />                DEAN
<br />    Sorry?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />        (Shouts)
<br />    Am I your wife!?
<br />
<br />                DEAN
<br />    No! What the fuck!?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Well I must be your whore then cause you are fucking me hard, Dean.
<br />
<br />                DEAN
<br />    What are you talking about?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Where's my money?
<br />
<br />                DEAN
<br />    What money? Everyone was paid on Monday, if you want a raise then bring it up another day cause I'm busy.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    I was talking about my super.
<br />
<br />Dean looks at Jimmy with a puzzled expression.
<br />
<br />                DEAN
<br />    Your super is where it needs to be.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    In your own investments making you money instead of me?
<br />
<br />                DEAN
<br />        (Leans over the desk to assert dominance)
<br />    Okay, even if it is there, there's not much you can really do about it.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    I don't want to do anything about it. I just need to hear you say it. And I'm not recording shit.
<br />
<br />                DEAN
<br />        (Thinks for a moment)
<br />    Okay. I'm using your money for my own
<br />
<br />                DEAN (CONT'D)
<br />    profit and as a result you loose out on interest made in your own fund.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Okay. Thank you.
<br />
<br />Jimmy gets up out of his chair and begins for the door but turns around.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY (CONT'D)
<br />    How well has this all worked out for you?
<br />
<br />                DEAN
<br />        (Smiles)
<br />    Very well.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    I see. Crime's worth it aye?
<br />
<br />                DEAN
<br />    When you do it right.
<br />
<br />Jimmy nods in response.
<br />
<br />                DEAN (CONT'D)
<br />    Is there anything else I can help you with Mr...?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Ricard.
<br />
<br />Pause. Jimmy slowly walks back towards the desk without saying a word. Jimmy pulls out the handgun and aims it at Dean's head.
<br />
<br />                DEAN
<br />        (Shouts)
<br />    Holy shit!
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Like I said, today I've had a small revelation.
<br />
<br />                DEAN
<br />    Look, if you kill me, your money is lost forever. That's about $4,000 down the drain plus whatever you make on top of that.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />        (Chuckles)
<br />    I don't care about the money.
<br />
<br />                DEAN
<br />    Then what do you want?
<br />
<br />There is a pause as Jimmy thinks. While Jimmy begins to talk, Dean slowly reaches underneath the desk.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />        (Chuckles)
<br />    What do I want?
<br />
<br />Pause. Jimmy thinks. He quotes Winston Churchill.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY (CONT'D)
<br />    To wage war, by sea, land and air, with all my might and with all the strength that God can give me...
<br />
<br />Dean reaches further as Jimmy closes his eyes and looks up at a slight incline as he recites historical speeches about war.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY (CONT'D)
<br />        (Beginning to raise his voice)
<br />    To wage war against a monstrous tyranny,
<br />
<br />Dean pulls out a handgun from underneath the table as Jimmy says the following line. Jimmy begins to quote Menachem Begin.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY (CONT'D)
<br />        (Shouting)
<br />    Thirsting only for freedom, for righteousness...
<br />
<br />Dean aims the gun at jimmy but he is not fast enough. Jimmy pulls the trigger. A camera shot from outside the building shows blood explode out onto the window behind Jimmy's boss.
<br />
<br />The camera then changes to inside the warehouse where it is loud and apparent that no one heard the gunshot due to the loud noise inside the warehouse.
<br />
<br />Camera cuts to Jimmy again holding the gun. Jimmy opens his eyes.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY (CONT'D)
<br />        (Said calmly)
<br />    And for justice.
<br />
<br />Jimmy exhales. He begins to walk towards the desk and picks up the keys on the desk for the office.
<br />
<br />Jimmy then exits the room and looks the door. He breaks the key in the lock so as to not allow anyone else into the room.
<br />
<br />INT./EXT. CAR - MORNING - MOVING - SAME DAY
<br />
<br />Jimmy is driving out of the parking lot of his work. As he turns a corner Ellis is standing in the middle of the road. Jimmy stops the car and the two share eye contact for a few moments.
<br />
<br />Camera then cuts to a double shot of the two of them in the front of the car driving. It stays silent for some time before Ellis breaks the silence.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    You did it?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Yup.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    No hiccups?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Nup.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    Really?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />        (shaking his head)
<br />    Nup.
<br />
<br />Ellis pauses for a moment with an impressed look on his face before continuing.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    My first didn't work out as well. Got messy.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Yeah, how so?
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    I shot him and then he started bleeding out, didn't have it in me to shoot him again so I watched him for 45 minutes bleed out and slowly die.
<br />        (Pauses.)
<br />    How'd you do it? Shot him?
<br />
<br />Jimmy nods his head. Another long silence.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    I recited war poetry.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    You did?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Yup.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    Nice.
<br />        (Long pause.)
<br />    You know you can't always shoot people when you do it?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />        (looks over to Ellis)
<br />    Why not?
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    Well you won't get any attention, you won't be able to compete for the big contracts. You gotta... you know... get creative and diversify your portfolio.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Like come up with new ways of killing people?
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    Yeah. You got any cigarettes in 'ere?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Yeah, in the glove box. Well, give me an example of how to kill people.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    Well, there's no real example I can give, you just gotta do something to get attention.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Yeah? What did you do to get attention?
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    What fuck are these cigarettes?
<br />        (puts the cigarette out on the interior of the car)
<br />    I fucked up a dude with a vice.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Those are my ex's, she liked that floral smoke shit I dunno.
<br />        (Pause before fully realising what Ellis said.)
<br />    You fucked up a guy with a vice and it fucking killed him?
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    Well, traditionally the vice is used for torture, instead of putting a finger or a penis in it, I put his head in it.
<br />INT. WORKSHOP - DAY - FLASHBACK
<br />
<br />Camera cuts to a flashback of Ellis cranking a vice. The camera is looking up to Ellis as if from the perspective of the man in the vice. Ellis voices over the flashback.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING (CONT'D)
<br />    Honestly, it didn't go down as expected. I thought it would crack the skull and brains would slowly ooze out.
<br />
<br />Ellis cranks until screaming stop and blood splatters all over his face. He has a look of slight shock on his face.
<br />
<br />INT./EXT. CAR - MOVING
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Well what happened?
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    It popped.
<br />        (pointing to the right)
<br />    Oh yes! Right here! This is it.
<br />
<br />Jimmy pulls over and stops the car. The two step out and walk into an empty cafe; "Blanche Cafe". The two of them walk up to the counter and wait to be seated. A waiter immediately seats them.
<br />
<br />                WAITER
<br />    Table for two?
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    Yes.
<br />
<br />                WAITER
<br />    And is it lunch or just coffee?
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    WE won't be here long, bring out...
<br />        (thinks for a moment)
<br />    a bottle of orange juice.
<br />        (looks to Jimmy)
<br />    And...
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    I'm good.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />        (To the waiter)
<br />    A...
<br />        (To Jimmy)
<br />    What?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    I'm good.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    Ah okay, that'll be all.
<br />
<br />The two sit at a nearby table in the small empty cafe with only one waiter.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    See now, the whole creativity thing dies off once you make a name for yourself. You can go back to just shooting people. But I take it upon myself to get the creative juices flowing for a passion project every now and then. Today's that day.
<br />
<br />Waiter comes over with the orange juice bottle and a glass. He places both on the table and begins to walk away. Ellis opens the bottle and takes a sip.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING (CONT'D)
<br />    Excuse me waiter!
<br />
<br />Waiter returns quickly as he had not made it far away.
<br />
<br />                WAITER
<br />    Yes.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    This juice taste strange. Here, try it, I dunno the pulp is off or something.
<br />
<br />                WAITER
<br />    I'm sorry? Can I get you another.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    Just try the dam juice.
<br />
<br />                WAITER
<br />        (confused)
<br />    Okay...
<br />
<br />The waiter is the kind of person who places his whole mouth around the lid of the juice bottle. As he does so, Ellis quickly punches the bottom of the juice bottle so it goes right into the mouth of the waiter, breaking his teeth and letting blood spill out.
<br />
<br />He screams in pain. Ellis quickly kicks him in the head and knocks him out. Jimmy isn't phased by the proceedings as he is starting to grow custom to this new life of crime.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />        (To Jimmy)
<br />    Well what the fuck? pick him up and put him in the trunk.
<br />INT./EXT. CAR - MIDAY - MOVING - SAME DAY
<br />
<br />Ellis and Jimmy drive past a sign that says "Cassowary Farm". They arrive it Jane Herrington's farm.
<br />
<br />EXT. CASSOWARY FARM - DAY
<br />
<br />Camera immediately cuts to the body being thrown into a fenced off enclosure. The waiter regains consciousness.
<br />
<br />Ellis and Jimmy are standing behind a tall fence looking through seeing what's happening.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    I think this may be my best work yet.
<br />
<br />The waiter looks around as he is confused where he is. There is blood all over his clothes from his injury.
<br />
<br />He stands up and then looks in front of him to see a cassowary. The Camera cuts to Jimmy and Ellis looking into the enclosure over the shoulders of them.
<br />
<br />As the cassowary walks over and starts tearing away at the waiter with its talons, Ellis and Jimmy begin to walk away.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING (CONT'D)
<br />    I think I have an idea as to how you're to get attention. Meet me at this address tonight.
<br />        (Hands sticky note.)
<br />    You wanna be there just after happy hour.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    What's the plan?
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    I'll explain at the bar.
<br />
<br />The two of them walk away while spaghetti-western guitar begins to play.
<br />
<br />The camera follows them on their way back to the car. As the close the doors once they're in the car, the scene ends.
<br />
<br />INT. THE BANK (BAR) - NIGHT - SAME DAY
<br />
<br />Jimmy walks into the bar with a large sign above the door with the words "The Bank". Music is playing as Jimmy enters with a large group of men standing by the bar.
<br />
<br />Jimmy walks past a girl reading a book. He arrives at the bar, four meters to the left of the group of men. The men are laughing and talking whilst drinking beer.
<br />
<br />                BARTENDER
<br />    You cool?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Pot of CD thanks.
<br />
<br />Jimmy leans on the bar with his back facing the bar. He's looking out and around for Ellis. The Bartender comes back with his beer. Jimmy takes a sip.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />        (under his breath)
<br />    Fucking full price and the old man 'aint even here.
<br />
<br />A nearby payphone rings. The bartender looks at Jimmy with a notion for him to pick it up as he's the closest.
<br />
<br />He walks over and picks up the phone.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Hello?
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    Love the shirt you're wearing, shame you wore something nice.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    That you Ellis?
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    Yup, listen up, those men at the bar there are part of a gang called the Moguls. This here bar is their local watering-hole. I want you to kill all those guys there.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    What the fuck!? There's like ten of them?
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    You got your gun?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Yes! But that ain't gonna do shit against ten dudes.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    I left a present for you in the bin at your feet. Use your gun as a last resort.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Why are we attacking a gang?
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    I've done work for their rivals, the Spinks, in the past. Maybe if you do
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING (CONT'D)
<br />    well here the Spinks will wanna talk with you. Maybe you'll get a job. But right now, you gotta grab their attention.
<br />
<br />Ellis hangs up. Jimmy places the phone back and continues to reach into the bin where Ellis has left a large knife. "Foreign Fruits" by Peach Fur begins to play as Jimmy walks over to the closest man sitting at the bar.
<br />
<br />Jimmy pushes the back of the mans neck down forcing his head onto the bar counter. Jimmy then stabs him multiple times in the back. Another man close to Jimmy begins to pull out a pistol.
<br />
<br />As the pistol comes out and is pointed to the left of Jimmy he grabs the hand holding the pistol and cuts it off at the wrist. He shakes the hand off the pistol and shoots the same man in the stomach.
<br />
<br />He grabs the man around the neck and uses him as a shield while he receives fire from the other men. The man being used as a shield is torn to shreds by bullets. Jimmy shoots two men in the face whilst still using the man as a shield. He proceeds to shove him away once he's finished and shoot him in the head from behind.
<br />
<br />Jimmy, holding the knife in his other hand, flips a table towards one of the men. This catches the man off guard and Jimmy shoots him in the shoulder. He proceeds to duck from fire and go into a crouching position proceeding to then stab the man he just shot on the inside of the thigh. He then uses this man as a shield as he crouches and fires back at the five remaining men; killing two of them by shooting them in the face.
<br />
<br />Jimmy runs out of ammo from the gun, drops it, and pulls out his own gun from behind (it was tucked into the back of his pants). The Bartender then appears in the frame with a shotgun. Jimmy pulls the knife out from the man's thigh and throws it directly into the face of the Bartender.
<br />
<br />The remaining men have fired so much that they are now all simultaneously out of ammo. Jimmy grabs the shotgun on the nearby floor from the hands of the dead Bartender.
<br />
<br />The remaining three now hide behind tables as the reload. Jimmy fires into one of the tables with the shotgun killing one man from behind.
<br />
<br />He stands and waits some time before another stands up from cover to shoot but Jimmy shoots him quickly with his pistol in the other hand. He pauses and waits for the remaining man to either give up or stand to shoot.
<br />
<br />Camera cuts to the remaining man who is nervous as he holds his gun, looking as if he is about to cry.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Do you wanna do this?
<br />
<br />                MAN #1
<br />        (Trembling with fear)
<br />    What the fuck is this? We didn't do shit!
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    It's nothing personal. Come on, just stand up and we can talk the rest of this out. I was just intimidated by all your bigger friends back there.
<br />
<br />By this point, all the other patrons of the bar have left due to the violence. The two of them are all alone.
<br />
<br />                MAN #1
<br />    What do you want?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    I just wanna talk with you face to face.
<br />
<br />                MAN #1
<br />    How the fuck do I know you're not just gonna shoot me as a stand up.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    I have a message for your boss, Mogul, who else is gonna tell him my message if I kill you?
<br />
<br />                MAN #1
<br />    Okay, I'm getting up then. Put the guns down.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Sure thing Sugar Ray.
<br />
<br />Jimmy throws the shotgun on the ground. Then he makes a similar sound with his foot to imitate the sound of the pistol hitting the ground.
<br />
<br />He places the gun behind him in his belt. The remaining man peeks his head over the table he's hiding behind and sees Jimmy is unarmed he begins to stand.
<br />
<br />                MAN #1
<br />    What the fuck is all...
<br />
<br />Jimmy pulls out the gun from behind and shoots him in the head. He moves back to where he left his beer and sits down. He finishes the beer quickly.
<br />
<br />The payphone rings. Jimmy picks it up. The voice is unfamiliar.
<br />
<br />                VOICE
<br />    Shop 26/45, Collins Street. Walk in and ask for a double glazed back and sides with a fringe on top.
<br />
<br />The Voice hangs up. Jimmy places the phone down and stares out at what he's done.
<br />
<br />INT. JAE'S CUTTING LOUNGE - NIGHT - TWO DAYS LATER
<br />
<br />Jimmy walks in to the busy barber and approaches the counter. The man at the counter looks friendly.
<br />
<br />                EMPLOYEE #1
<br />    You after a cut?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Yeah...
<br />        (He pauses)
<br />    Double glazed back and sides with a fringe on top.
<br />
<br />                EMPLOYEE #1
<br />    I see.
<br />        (to another emloyee)
<br />    Take him for a double glazed back and sides.
<br />
<br />                EMPLOYEE #2
<br />        (making motioning gesture)
<br />    This way sir.
<br />
<br />The two walk right through all the cutting stations to a door at the back of the shop. They walk through into the darkness. The camera follows them from behind. Screen goes dark as the enter the dark hallway behind the door.
<br />
<br />INT. SPINK'S OFFICE - NIGHT
<br />
<br />The employee closes the door behind them. Screen is black. A dim light is lit up revealing a door. The employee opens the door and allows Jimmy to go in first.
<br />
<br />Jimmy walks into a low lit office with a man at a desk in the middle with a desk lamp on. Everything else is dark.
<br />
<br />                MR SPINKS
<br />    Ah Jimmy! Ellis has told me all about you. I get this call two nights ago whilst I'm out for dinner with my wife's step-niece telling me someone's attacking The Bank and the men inside. I say perfect, ring him up and bring him over. Sure enough I get a call from that old bastard Redding saying you new in the game and are looking for business. Well, I'd like to offer you some employment.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    I'm sorry, I missed your name.
<br />
<br />                MR SPINKS
<br />    Spinks.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Oh.
<br />
<br />                MR SPINKS
<br />    You got quite a talent scout working in your favor Jimmy. Ellis is quite a talent himself.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    I'm afraid him and I aren't well acquainted yet.
<br />
<br />                MR SPINKS
<br />    Oh, so you don't know how he got into business?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    No?
<br />
<br />                MR SPINKS
<br />    Oh, well Ellis's story is more than a biography, it's more of a genesis.
<br />        (pause)
<br />                MR SPINKS (CONT'D)
<br />    A graduate of law school, a young wife, a small house in the country. It was all taken from him in a moment of passion. A well known gang at the time robbed him, burnt his house down with his 19 year old pregnant wife in it while he worked late.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    He wanted revenge?
<br />
<br />                MR SPINKS
<br />    No, revenge doesn't do justice to what Ellis went on to do. It was more than revenge. It was grand, elaborate... beautiful.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    What did he do?
<br />
<br />                MR SPINKS
<br />    He buried his newly-wed wife then changed his name, appearance and demeanor, he became Ellis Redding on that day. He joined the very gang that killed his wife. For 20 years he worked in the gang of mobsters who robbed his house. Making his way up the food chain. He worked his way all the way to the top. But his denouement was about to come.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    So what happened?
<br />
<br />                MR SPINKS
<br />        (pauses)
<br />    He called a meeting with all the men and their families; wives and children. Brought them to a warehouse the gang owned. He locked the doors, no way out. He then burnt the whole place to the ground.
<br />        (pauses)
<br />    Ever since then he's been a little cold. Your father was his first job for me.
<br />
<br />Short silence as Jimmy digests what Spinks said.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    First job?
<br />
<br />                MR SPINKS
<br />    Yup.
<br />        (Pauses.)
<br />    This here is Jo-Ji Torrence.
<br />
<br />A small blonde headed girl steps out from the shadow.
<br />
<br />                JO-JI
<br />    G'day tricky.
<br />
<br />Jimmy nods in response. Suddenly a man appears in the room from the door.
<br />
<br />                MAN #2
<br />    Spinks, fighter 22 is new. Your call.
<br />
<br />                MR SPINKS
<br />    How's he look?
<br />
<br />                MAN #2
<br />    Like he can hold himself but not against Jack.
<br />
<br />                MR SPINKS
<br />    Okay, put Jack up against him, spike his adrenaline shot and tell the punters we're gon' win.
<br />
<br />                MAN #2
<br />    Gotchya sir.
<br />
<br />Man leaves the room.
<br />
<br />                MR SPINKS
<br />    Jo here is my second hand. You have any problems, go to her and she'll handle you all good.
<br />
<br />Jimmy looks back over to Jo-Ji; she is starring lustfully at him. Jimmy is not interested in the same way.
<br />
<br />                JO-JI
<br />    Come to me and I'll decide if what you got to say is worth sayin to Spinky here. He's a busy man you see, Perky.
<br />
<br />                MR SPINKS
<br />    I think he understands Jo. Alright
<br />
<br />                MR SPINKS (CONT'D)
<br />    Jimmy, you're probably gonna wanna know what your job involves.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    That would be of some use I guess.
<br />
<br />Jo-ji laughs in response. The laugh is loud and obnoxious. There are clearly a few kangaroos loose in the top paddock.
<br />
<br />She begins to unzip her backpack and emptying the contents of the bag.
<br />
<br />In the bag there are strange inanimate objects like a dildo, matches, lots of knives, rope, porno magazines and blood bags.
<br />
<br />She then reaches into the bag and pulls out a handgun. She begins to shoot into the wall as if to test the gun.
<br />
<br />She continually shoots into the wall while Spinks talks. Spinks just talks through it as if nothing is wrong. Jimmy is weirded out by all of this.
<br />
<br />                MR SPINKS
<br />    Well, how it works is this. I tell you first who I want dead, I put a time limit on. Say i tell you that you have a day to kill him, it might be urgent.
<br />        (Gunshot)
<br />    If I don't receive word from you that they're dead within the time limit, this here computer automatically tells my gang, and every other hitman...
<br />        (Gunshot)
<br />    ...in the area that your head is up for grabs as well as the man you were supposed to kill.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />        (Slight chuckle)
<br />    Geeze, that sounds like pressure.
<br />
<br />                MR SPINKS
<br />    Let's just say that people usually retire early.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />        (Gunshot)
<br />    Okay, what's the money like then?
<br />
<br />                MR SPINKS
<br />    It's tasty Jimmy, very tasty. Just make sure you get those kills on time, otherwise this program automatically puts a very large price on you. I'm the only one who knows the key to stopping the timer so you tell me when your target is dead. Okay?
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Sure thing. Why's that?
<br />
<br />                MR SPINKS
<br />    Had a bad experience once with a bad contractor, just covering my footsteps Jimmy.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Fair fair.
<br />        (To Jo-Ji)
<br />    Why are you shooting the wall?
<br />
<br />Jo-Ji just looks at him with confusion as if there's something wrong with him.
<br />
<br />                MR SPINKS
<br />    Come on down to the fight, they're about to start. Jo here is fighting in a bit.
<br />
<br />Spinks gets up and walks over to a nearby door, followed by Jo-Ji. He opens the door to the sound of a crowd chanting.
<br />
<br />INT. FIGHT AREA - NIGHT
<br />
<br />They walk down a staircase into a big abandoned warehouse. In the middle is a big crowd of men surrounding two men fighting.
<br />
<br />                MR SPINKS (CONT'D)
<br />    Jimmy, we make money off of the bets these sad sods place. Fucking rains green here every night.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    You rig the fights?
<br />
<br />                MR SPINKS
<br />    Not quite. We are just very good at telling who's gonna win. Then we get a large commission from all the winning
<br />
<br />                MR SPINKS (CONT'D)
<br />    bets.
<br />
<br />Man #2 comes up and whispers something in Spinks's ear. In the background an announcer shouts out Jo-Ji's name as she is about to fight. Jimmy and Spinks are behind the crowd and can't see the fight as they discuss.
<br />
<br />                MR SPINKS (CONT'D)
<br />    There goes Jo.
<br />        (Laughs a little and points to the fight before continuing before the man resumes whispering into Spinks's ear)
<br />    I see.
<br />        (Pauses to think)
<br />    Jimmy, looks like you're starting early. Fighter 22, turns out he's got a punch harder than a jimbo in a skippy on the sabbath, even with a little heroin in his system. He just lost us a lot of money. With new fighters we often flood the punters with good rates, they take the bite cause it's likely the newbie will lose, we make sure that is a certainty. We can't afford having these unbeatable fighters in the game. He just beat my best guy so he has to go. Best yet, he's a fucking Mogul, and you know what we call a dead mogul in a bodybag, oildrum full of acid or a shredder? Public service.
<br />
<br />Spinks turns away and begins to walk off.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Spinks!
<br />
<br />Spinks turns around.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY (CONT'D)
<br />    What's it look like.
<br />
<br />Spinks thinks about it for a moment.
<br />
<br />                MR SPINKS
<br />    He's the fucking bottom of the food chain...
<br />        (pauses to think)
<br />    $20,000, I want it done by 5 tomorrow.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Groovy.
<br />
<br />                MR SPINKS
<br />        (Turning to men following him)
<br />    I like him, he fucking listens to me unlike some of you cocksuckers.
<br />
<br />Camera cuts to the fight where Jo-Ji is brutally smashing the head of a man twice her size into the concrete floor. The announcer shouts out her name as she wins.
<br />
<br />She stands up straight putting up her arms in victory as she is covered in the blood of the man she just beat. She kneels down next to the bloody of the man and kisses him and then gets up to celebrate her victory again.
<br />
<br />                MR SPINKS (CONT'D)
<br />        (Smiles)
<br />    Looks like she won.
<br />
<br />Spinks turns around and walks off.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />INT./EXT. CAR - MOVING
<br />
<br />"Fuzzy Connection" by Shag Rock is playing. Royce is driving a car down the freeway.
<br />
<br />Royce is of a slightly muscular build. Athletic in appearence. He is wearing a white t-shirt tucked into his jeans with sunglasses on.
<br />
<br />The sun is out as he drives down the road and the weather is good for a swim.
<br />
<br />On the seat next to him is a packed duffel bag.
<br />
<br />The car drives into the parking lot of a motel. 
<br />Nights Abroad Motel.
<br />EXT. NIGHTS ABROAD MOTEL - DAY
<br />
<br />Royce parks the car and stares at the front reception for a moment.
<br />
<br />Two young girls walk out the door. Both are wearing high waisted jean shorts and small crop tops.
<br />
<br />One of which is blonde, the other brunette. The blonde girl is Jo-Ji.
<br />
<br />They see the parked car, the rest of the parking lot is empty. The two of them walk over to the car.
<br />
<br />Jo-Ji leans through the open passenger window of Royce's car.
<br />
<br />                JO-JI
<br />    Howdy tricky. What seems to be your business here?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Just passing through.
<br />
<br />                JO-JI
<br />        (looking him up and down; she talks in a seductive manner)
<br />    How long you plan on staying?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />        (Smiling)
<br />    It depends on how long it takes for me to get what needs to be done... done.
<br />
<br />                JO-JI
<br />    Well, tell the lady at reception when you walk in that Jo said you're more than welcome to stay.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    And did I do to earn your recomendation?
<br />
<br />                JO-JI
<br />    Not much really, I just wanna see how this all goes down.
<br />
<br />Royce begins to get out the car and brings his duffel bag along with him. He stands up straight and looks Jo-Ji in the eyes as he slings his bag over his shoulder.
<br />
<br />The brunette girl begins to walk away.
<br />
<br />                CULTGIRL #1
<br />    I'll meet you in the sauna with the others when you're done here.
<br />
<br />                JO-JI
<br />    Okay!
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Sauna?
<br />
<br />                JO-JI
<br />    Yeah, just heading there with Flower to meet a couple other people.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    I don't see any towels.
<br />
<br />                JO-JI
<br />        (seductively)
<br />    We don't use towels.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />        (Chuckles. Pauses before speaking again)
<br />    You work here or something?
<br />
<br />                JO-JI
<br />    Nope.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    So what are you then?
<br />
<br />                JO-JI
<br />    A regular resident.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />        (Surprised)
<br />    I see.
<br />
<br />                JO-JI
<br />    I don't shag for cash though. Don't get me wrong.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    I didn't assume anything. How old are you?
<br />
<br />                JO-JI
<br />    Old enough to know what's good for me.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />        (Slight chuckle)
<br />    I see.
<br />
<br />                JO-JI
<br />    You should meet Ricky when you're all checked in.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    He a friend of yours?
<br />
<br />                JO-JI
<br />    Yes.
<br />        (Laughing)
<br />    But he's of more importance than that.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    So what is he then? Why should I meet him?
<br />
<br />                JO-JI
<br />    He owns the place. Lives in 89 over there.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    And what interest do I have with the proprietor?
<br />
<br />                JO-JI
<br />    I think he might have something interesting for you.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />        (Pause)
<br />    89?
<br />
<br />                JO-JI
<br />    89.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Okay.
<br />        (Pause)
<br />    What'd you say your name was?
<br />
<br />                JO-JI
<br />    People call me Jo, or Jo-Ji.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Is that short for soemthing?
<br />
<br />                JO-JI
<br />    Yeah, Joanna.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    I like Joanna.
<br />
<br />                JO-JI
<br />    Do you like anything else about me besides my name?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />        (Chuckles; sarcasm)
<br />    I like your personality.
<br />
<br />                JO-JI
<br />    So what's your name then Mr?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Jake Robertson.
<br />
<br />                JO-JI
<br />    What do you do with yourself?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    I clen up big messes.
<br />
<br />                JO-JI
<br />    That's good, cause I make big messes.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Perfect fit.
<br />
<br />Pause.
<br />
<br />                JO-JI
<br />    Go on and check in. Meet me at Ricky's door when you're done.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Sounds groovy.
<br />
<br />                JO-JI
<br />    Make sure you knock before going in his though, Ricky loves his rooting so you never know.
<br />
<br />Royce nods and walks towards the reception. Jo-Ji continues in the direction her friend went earlier.
<br />
<br />Royce reaches the door of the reception and stops to look out around the motel car-park.
<br />
<br />Lots of people are now outside looking at him. He walks through the door.
<br />
<br />INT. NIGHTS ABROAD MOTEL - DAY
<br />
<br />The RECEPTIONIST is sitting at the counter. A less inviting looking girl then the others as her mannerisms suggest she doesn't want to talk to anyone.
<br />
<br />Royce walks over to the counter. The Receptionist does not pay any attention to him even though he is standing right in front of her.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    I was told, to tell you that Jo says it's okay if I stay here a few nights.
<br />
<br />                RECEPTIONIST
<br />        (Condescendingly)
<br />    I'm afraid we have no vacancies.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    You sure? Cuase it seems like people don't mind bunking in this area.
<br />
<br />                RECEPTIONIST
<br />        (Pause)
<br />    Who are you?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    A customer.
<br />
<br />                RECEPTIONIST
<br />    Not yet you're not.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Soon to be?
<br />
<br />                RECEPTIONIST
<br />    You're gonna have to convince me.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    How does money sound?
<br />
<br />                RECEPTIONIST
<br />    We're very exclusive Mr...?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Customer.
<br />
<br />                RECEPTIONIST
<br />    Customer. So, I'm afraid Jo's word doesn't mean shit in here cause I can't just let you waddle in here and have a room.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    How do you think Ricky would feel if you deny him some profit?
<br />
<br />She looks at Royce a few moments before speaking again.
<br />
<br />                RECEPTIONIST
<br />    Okay, I'll give you a room then. Will that be all Mr Customer?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    That'll be all.
<br />
<br />                RECEPTIONIST
<br />    26.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Sorry?
<br />
<br />                RECEPTIONIST
<br />    That's your room. 26.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Do I get a key?
<br />
<br />                RECEPTIONIST
<br />    We don't have keys here sir.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    I see. Well, I'll see you round I guess.
<br />
<br />He goes to leave.
<br />
<br />EXT. NIGHTS ABROAD MOTEL - DAY
<br />
<br />Royce walks across the parking lot after exiting the reception. He looks towards room 89 as a man walks out in a night gown. RICKY.
<br />
<br />Ricky has long brown hair and is skinny.
<br />
<br />The two of them share eye contact as Royce walks towards his room.
<br />
<br />He reaches his room and walks through the already open door.
<br />
<br />INT. NIGHTS ABROAD MOTEL - DAY
<br />
<br />The room is a mess. There are old bed sheets and the place has bad smells. There are used condoms on the tallboy and dirty carpets.
<br />
<br />Royce puts down his bag and closes the door.
<br />
<br />He shows an expression of disgust towards the room before walking to the bedside table and opening the draw to see the Gideons bible in the empty draw.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />        (Under his breath; chuckle)
<br />    Rich.
<br />
<br />There's a knock on the door before it is opened. Jo-Ji is standing at the door.
<br />
<br />                JO-JI
<br />    Couldn't wait. Time to go.
<br />INT. RICKY'S ROOM - DAY
<br />
<br />Knocking can be heard on the door from outside. The voice of Jo-Ji is heard.
<br />
<br />                JO-JI
<br />    Ricky! I'm coming in with a guest!
<br />
<br />The door opens and Jo-Ji walks in with Royce.
<br />
<br />Ricky is lying on the couch by himself. He has a bottle in one hand.
<br />
<br />                JO-JI (CONT'D)
<br />    Ricky, this here is...
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />        (Reaches to shake hands.)
<br />    Jake.
<br />
<br />Ricky doesn't shake his hand.
<br />
<br />                JO-JI
<br />    I thought you'd like to meet him.
<br />
<br />There is a pause before Ricky sits up and responds.
<br />
<br />                RICKY
<br />    Of course! I'd love to meet our new welcomed guest. Please take a seat!
<br />
<br />Royce sits down on a chair next to the bed.
<br />
<br />                RICKY
<br />    That'll be all Jo.
<br />
<br />                JO-JI
<br />    Sure thing Ricky.
<br />
<br />Jo-Ji leaves the room.
<br />
<br />                RICKY
<br />    So, Jack, what interest do you have in Nights Abroad?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    No interest really. Just here on business.
<br />
<br />                RICKY
<br />    I see I see. Can I offer you a drink?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Sure.
<br />
<br />Ricky gets up and walks over to a nearby table where there is a variety of drinks.
<br />
<br />                RICKY
<br />    What do you take?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Whiskey's great.
<br />
<br />                RICKY
<br />    Whiskey it is!
<br />
<br />There is a close up of the glass as Ricky puts in a small pill and pours the drink. The pill dissolves quickly.
<br />
<br />                RICKY (CONT'D)
<br />    Now, did you like anything you saw on your way in?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    I'm sorry?
<br />
<br />                RICKY
<br />    The girls silly! Anything you liked?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Are you a pimp?
<br />
<br />                RICKY
<br />    No! Of course not! That kind of thing is illegal in this state sir. I'm just passionate about five star hospitality at my motel you see.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    So you have something to hide then?
<br />
<br />Ricky hands Royce his drink.
<br />
<br />                RICKY
<br />    No.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    If you say so.
<br />
<br />                RICKY
<br />    Well, see, I did say so, so that's exactly what you're gonna believe. Now... did you like anything you saw?
<br />
<br />Royce holds onto the drink and doesn't yet take a sip.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    They weren't really my type.
<br />
<br />                RICKY
<br />    Well, what is your type?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Adults.
<br />        (Pause)
<br />    Ricky, I'm an empirical and pragmatic man. You can tell me what needs to be told.
<br />
<br />                RICKY
<br />    There's nothing to be told... Jake.
<br />
<br />Royce takes a sip of his drink. Ricky smiles and reclines onto the bed.
<br />
<br />                RICKY (CONT'D)
<br />    Did you know that rabbits sleep with their eyes open?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    No. No I didn't.
<br />
<br />                RICKY
<br />    Well, let's find out if you're anything like a rabbit.
<br />
<br />Royce is confused by this gesture. He begins to fade slowly after this and pulls at the neck hole of his shirt.
<br />
<br />He slowly looses consciousness.
<br />
<br />INT. NIGHTS ABROAD MOTEL - NIGHT
<br />
<br />Royce regains consciousness. But he is heavily intoxicated. He is lying on a bed and as he regains consciousness he notices the IV line in his arm.
<br />
<br />Royce follows the tube up towards the hospital pouch it's coming from. He looks down and sees the straight alcohol bottle on the table.
<br />
<br />The cult members had hooked him up so that alcohol was running directly into his bloodstream.
<br />
<br />He tears the the line out of his arm and blood starts squirting everywhere.
<br />
<br />Slow spaghetti-western style guitar begins to play.
<br />
<br />He goes to get up but he manages to get half way into a standing position before falling directly to the floor.
<br />
<br />Royce has never been this drunk before.
<br />
<br />He begins to crawl towards the door. He has minimal control over his limbs however.
<br />
<br />He slowly slids on his face towards the door. He then sees some crackers on the counter.
<br />
<br />Royce knows that those might sober him up if he eats them.
<br />
<br />He then slids towards the crackers. He gets to the bottom of the tallboy and goes reach up with his arm but he can't get it.
<br />
<br />He then uses all his strength to knock the tallboy with his body so that the crackers fall off. He does and it works.
<br />
<br />He chews on the crackers and then attempts to crawl towards the door again.
<br />
<br />He gets to the door and uses his leg to open the door. His foot turning the door handle.
<br />
<br />EXT. NIGHTS ABROAD MOTEL - NIGHT
<br />
<br />Royce rolls onto the concrete floor outside his room. He notices that he was in room 88 instead of his room.
<br />
<br />Just as this all happens, two girls walk out of Ricky's room next door and see Royce struggeling.
<br />
<br />The two of them both drag him into the room while Royce yells.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    You fucking let go of me! I'm gonna stomp you're thick skulls in!
<br />INT. RICKY'S ROOM - NIGHT
<br />
<br />Royce is dumped on the floor in Ricky's room. Royce sees Ricky sitting on his bed. Ricky his shirtless.
<br />
<br />The two girls remain in the room.
<br />
<br />There is another man in the room holding a sharp knife.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />        (In a drunken manner)
<br />    Ricky!
<br />
<br />From Royces perspective, Ricky is making inaudiable conversation with the other man. Royce begins to look around as he cant tell what is happening.
<br />
<br />He then vomits all over the carpet and over one of the girls.
<br />
<br />                RICKY
<br />    Ah shit! What the fuck is this?
<br />
<br />Suddenly Royce is a whole lot better, he begins to sober up quickly.
<br />
<br />By vomitting he regains a lot of his cognitive ability. He isn't completely sober, but he can hold himself now.
<br />
<br />                RICKY (CONT'D)
<br />    Girls, take his shirt off.
<br />
<br />Ricky begins to take his trousers off by unzipping them and pulling them down.
<br />
<br />As the girls come near him he is able to sit up stright. He sobers up some more.
<br />
<br />One girl gives him some water from her water bottle and smiles at him. He smiles back.
<br />
<br />The other girl then takes his shirt off to reveal the microphone taped to his chest.
<br />
<br />Everyone in the room stops and looks at the microphone.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Oh shit, would you look at that!
<br />
<br />Royce punches the girl next to him in the nose and falls to the ground in pain, she bgeins to bleed everywhere as the blood flows from her nose. He continues to shove the other girl away from him as he stands up.
<br />
<br />The man with the knife starts at Royce while Ricky stands up straight on the bed in only his underwear away from the action.
<br />
<br />Royce defends himself from the knife.
<br />
<br />The remaining girl begins hitting Royce with a broom while Royce takes the other man to the ground.
<br />
<br />The two wrestle on the ground for a few moments before Royce is able to break the knife from the mans hand. All the while the girl is still hitting him with the broom.
<br />
<br />Royce dislocates the shoulder of the man with a kimoura trap (type of submission hold). The man screams and clutches onto his shoulder.
<br />
<br />As the girl goes to hit Royce again with the broom he grabs it and throws it away. He then grabs the head of the girl by clutching onto a scruff of her hair.
<br />
<br />He throws the face of the girl into the corner of the bed-frame. She falls to the ground unconscious.
<br />
<br />Ricky is still standing on the bed. He now has a broken glass bottle in hand.
<br />
<br />The two stare at each other for a little as they wait for the other to make the first move.
<br />
<br />Royce then quickly flips the whole bedframe. Ricky falls with the bed and lands up beneath it.
<br />
<br />Ricky shuffles his way out from underneath the mattress but as he does, Royce stomps on his wrist, forcing Ricky to let go of the broken bottle.
<br />
<br />Royce then kicks Ricky in the side of the head, knocking him out cold.
<br />
<br />EXT. NIGHTS ABROAD - NIGHT
<br />
<br />There are now lots of cars in the carpark of the place as police begin arresting people in the rooms.
<br />
<br />Royce is seen sitting on the hood of his car as SERGeANT comes up to him with POLICE #1.
<br />
<br />                SERGEANT
<br />        (Patting Royce on the back)
<br />    Good job kid. We got most of 'em.
<br />
<br />Police #1 hands Royce a cigarette as Sergeant walks away. Royce lights his own cigarette and he is left alone.
<br />
<br />INT. THE BANK (BAR) - NIGHT
<br />
<br />Title sequence "The Fish" appears and Royce begins speaking over it. Note that Police #1 can be played by either a man or a woman. The screen fades in to a medium shot of the policeman, Royce is not in the shot.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Nah, that wouldn't fucking work. You'd
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO (CONT'D)
<br />    be dead quick. I reckon I got it all figured out.
<br />
<br />                POLICE #1
<br />        (Laughs)
<br />    Do explain.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Okay hear me out. Hypothetically, if I were to indulge myself in rape, (pause) I wouldn't have any issue in doing so. See, I'm a fighter, I can beat a grown man, no doubt about that. If the only thing between me and something I want is a woman, I'm gonna get it. So naturally I start thinking of ways to stop me from becoming a rapist, and a bright idea hit me... you would be less likely to have sex with a girl on her period, maybe if you're a bit wild, but ideally you don't want her to be bleeding.
<br />
<br />                POLICE #1
<br />    Yeah? I'd imagine that wouldn't exactly stop a rapist though.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    I know I know! That's why we'd need some kinda super period to prevent a dude from raping her. Like imagine, if the rapist pulls down this poor girl's pants and then BAM! blood explodes everywhere! Now he's thinking "Fuck! there's something wrong with this vagina! she could have some kinda strange pussy exploding STD or somethin'" And that is how I solved rape. If a girl just wears a bag of blood rigged to explode, and say it's like strapped to her leg or something, and as soon as the pants come down it explodes, the dude is gonna be less likely to rape her.
<br />
<br />                POLICE #1
<br />        (Laughing)
<br />    What the fuck is wrong with you?
<br />
<br />                POLICE #1 (CONT'D)
<br />    You're fucked up! I hope you know that.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    As fucking cops we need to be thinking about ways to stop all that shit happening to women. Fuck! I mean that almost happened to me!
<br />
<br />                POLICE #1
<br />    I don't think that would exactly pass any kinda legislation in parliament so don't get your hopes up.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />        (Laughs)
<br />    I just think it could be a business idea that some women may invest in. Who knows? What the fuck are we doing in this piece of shit bar anyways? I've never heard of this place.
<br />
<br />                POLICE #1
<br />    Well Royce, I'm glad you finally asked after all that rape shit, but this is your new assignment.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Oh okay, what are we looking at?
<br />
<br />                POLICE #1
<br />    Well, this is the central hub of an organised crime gang run by Mogul. They handle the gambling out of this bar, it's kept to a need to know basis so they don't have randoms walking in here placing bets on those underground fights. Now, these guys don't exactly advertise jobs online so it was hard to come by ways of infiltrating the gang to see what's going on but there's one thing they will likely accept.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    And what's that?
<br />
<br />                POLICE #1
<br />    Fighters. They're at the bottom of the heap in terms of the gang. Most of the
<br />
<br />                POLICE #1 (CONT'D)
<br />    fighters end up as errand boys, we pick em' up for petty crimes and usually carrying out the dirty work. So we know all about how these fighters function. They're easy to catch. We need you to enter this as a fighter and see what's happening on the inside. We have an informant who's worked his way into event organization, so basically he handles fight cards and new fighters. He's got us a fight this coming Thursday, fighter 22. Now we must warn you, these gangs don't like new guys, so it won't come as a surprise if they throw the hardest hitter at you.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Sure, let's do it.
<br />
<br />                POLICE #1
<br />    Just do what you can to dismantle the gang without blowing your cover. Be careful of the opposing gang too, the Spinks Boys, also rough guys. They'll cut you if ya get too close. All we need is testimony to something more than just petty crime, we need to catch Spinks with some big charges. Once we've got that, we'll pull you out.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Sounds good.
<br />
<br />                POLICE #1
<br />    That's all I know I'm afraid, the rest is in this here folder. If you have any questions, I suggest you contact someone more qualified.
<br />
<br />Police #1 hands folder over and gets up to leave.
<br />
<br />                POLICE #1 (CONT'D)
<br />    Best o' luck kid.
<br />
<br />Royce opens the folder and reads the profile.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />        (Chuckles)
<br />    Royce Dario.
<br />
<br />He takes a sip of the whiskey placed next to him, he reads the folder for a while before lighting a cigarette. From across the room he sees a girl; Roxanne Mogul.
<br />
<br />She is alone at a booth reading 
<br />The Old Man and the Sea, with what can only be a security detail at nearby tables.
<br />Royce observes her from afar and is transfixed by her. At that moment, a brawl breaks out in the bar. Police #1 runs back into the booth. This is the same fight that Jimmy started.
<br />
<br />                POLICE #1
<br />    Come on! Bit of a jingle between the gangs so we're gonna hit it. Careful, it's chokkers out 'ere.
<br />
<br />Royce gets out of the booth and follows the policeman towards the door before he bumps into a large man. The large man is a part of a security detail for Roxanne Mogul.
<br />
<br />Royce is captivated by the beauty of Roxanne and smiles in response to the accident.
<br />
<br />This moment is cut short by the punch thrown by the security guard into Royce's face, knocking him out.
<br />
<br />INT. POLICE STATION - LATER ON THAT NIGHT
<br />
<br />The office space of the police station. Royce is sitting in his office chair at his desk, Police #1 is standing by with the Sergeant of the station. Royce is holding an ice-pack on the side of his head.
<br />
<br />                SERGEANT
<br />    You plan on doing what!?
<br />
<br />                POLICE #1
<br />    Woah okay, it's more reasonable than at first glance.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    I'm capable.
<br />
<br />                SERGEANT
<br />        (to Royce)
<br />    You reckon you can handle it on your
<br />
<br />                SERGEANT (CONT'D)
<br />    own though? We can't help if you get into trouble.
<br />
<br />                POLICE #1
<br />    Sir, this is our chance to finally take the gang down and manage to put charges on Mogul. Otherwise we'll be scratching our heads for the next few years.
<br />
<br />                SERGEANT
<br />        (Stops to think)
<br />    It is an awfully divisive plan.
<br />        (pauses)
<br />    You reckon you can actually do it though?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    All we need is testimony, I could get closer to her than Mogul.
<br />
<br />                SERGEANT
<br />    Why's that?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    She's more accessible than Mogul.
<br />
<br />                POLICE #1
<br />    Mogul is less likely to reveal details about former criminal activity. His wife on the other hand...
<br />
<br />                SERGEANT
<br />    You say you came up with this on the way here?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Yup.
<br />
<br />                SERGEANT
<br />    Well, if you get your dick cut off for it don't complain then.
<br />        (to Police #1)
<br />    Wrap this up.
<br />
<br />Sergeant walks away. Royce nods to the policeman as the two share eye contact.
<br />
<br />INT. CHANGE ROOM - NIGHT OF THE FIGHT
<br />
<br />Royce is sitting alone in the room. The informant of the police enters the room with a bag on his back; Harry Cobbs.
<br />
<br />                HARRY COBBS
<br />    Shit, kid you got a handful. They stuck you with the best they got. Whenever it's a Mogul and Spink fighter they get pretty tough.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    What's he look like?
<br />
<br />                HARRY COBBS
<br />    He's bigger than you, that's for sure.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Does he look like he knows how to fight?
<br />
<br />                HARRY COBBS
<br />    Dunno bout martial arts but he looks like can handle himself.
<br />
<br />Harry puts the bag down and unzips it.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    How does the fight end?
<br />
<br />                HARRY COBBS
<br />    It goes by a "when the crowd decides" basis.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    So the crowd could decide you're going to die basically?
<br />
<br />                HARRY COBBS
<br />    Yup, better hope you're the better fighter, you got reason to be.
<br />
<br />Harry pulls out a packaging with tablets in it.
<br />
<br />                HARRY COBBS (CONT'D)
<br />    Here, take these.
<br />
<br />Throws him two tablets.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    What is it?
<br />
<br />He swallows it down with the water next to him.
<br />
<br />                HARRY COBBS
<br />    Morphine.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Oh, shit.
<br />
<br />                HARRY COBBS
<br />    Hey kid, look...
<br />        (Walks over to the door to see if it's locked)
<br />    If you screw this up it'll make me look bad, they'll start sniffing around.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Of course, I can only do as good as I can right?
<br />
<br />A man suddenly walks in.
<br />
<br />                MAN #3
<br />    Fighter 22? Your AD is coming, fight starts in 3.
<br />
<br />                HARRY COBBS
<br />    Cheers.
<br />
<br />Man leaves and closes door. The two men look to each other and hold eye contact. Pause.
<br />
<br />                HARRY COBBS
<br />    Hey, listen up, I got soemthing to tell ya.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Shoot.
<br />
<br />Another man comes through the door with a needle and interrupts.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO (CONT'D)
<br />    What's this?
<br />
<br />                HARRY COBBS
<br />    Adrenalin.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Okay.
<br />
<br />Royce takes the injection. The man quickly leaves. Royce suddenly feels the heroin kick in.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO (CONT'D)
<br />    Shit, this is something.
<br />
<br />                HARRY COBBS
<br />    Yeah feels like a dream. Here look at this.
<br />
<br />Harry opens the bag to reveal its contents to Royce but not the camera.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Is that real?
<br />
<br />                HARRY COBBS
<br />    Yes, look, if things go sour, take it and hold onto it.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Sure but I'm confused.
<br />
<br />                HARRY COBBS
<br />    No time mate, I think my time is coming anyways, I been seein' guys lurkin' around my place.
<br />        (looks at his watch)
<br />    Time. Let's go.
<br />
<br />Royce gets up and takes shirt off. The heroin really starts to kick in. Royce struggles to focus.
<br />
<br />INT. FIGHT AREA - NIGHT
<br />
<br />The two walk to the fight. They enter the ring of men into the middle where Royce's opponent waits for him.
<br />
<br />                HARRY COBBS (CONT'D)
<br />    Get em'.
<br />
<br />[Fight Sequence]; Royce wins. During the fight he breaks his oponents arm and dislocates his shoulder. The fight was a struggle though cause Royce was high.)
<br />
<br />As Royce is walking away, he is struggleing to stay conscious. He blacks out.
<br />
<br />INT. THE BANK (BAR) - NIGHT - SAME DAY
<br />
<br />Royce wakes up with the bag on his chest. He is lying in a booth at the bar. There are several people in the bar celebrating.
<br />
<br />He wakes up sweating and slightly paranoid as he looks around. The camera slowly zooms in on him as he settles. He holds the bag tight to his chest. Roxanne enters.
<br />
<br />                ROXANNE MOGUL
<br />        (Jokingly)
<br />    Two fights in two days. Those punches look like they're going straight to your head.
<br />
<br />Royce stares at her for a moment before slightly laughing in response.
<br />
<br />                ROXANNE MOGUL (CONT'D)
<br />        (Stretching out to shake)
<br />    Roxanne.
<br />
<br />She sits down after they shake.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />        (slight chuckle)
<br />    I know who you are.
<br />
<br />                ROXANNE MOGUL
<br />        (Smiling)
<br />    Well I don't know who you are.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Royce.
<br />
<br />                ROXANNE MOGUL
<br />    Royce? How's that spelt?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    R-o-y-c-e.
<br />
<br />                ROXANNE MOGUL
<br />    Where is that name from?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    It's Brazilian.
<br />
<br />                ROXANNE MOGUL
<br />    You're Brazilian?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    No.
<br />        (chuckles)
<br />                ROYCE DARIO (CONT'D)
<br />    I was named after a fighter from Brazil. Royce Gracie. They pronounce his name with an H for an R though.
<br />
<br />                ROXANNE MOGUL
<br />    Oh okay. Was this fighter any good?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    I guess. Good enough for me to share a name with him I guess. Do you mind if I smoke?
<br />
<br />                ROXANNE MOGUL
<br />    Only if you offer me first.
<br />
<br />Royce smiles in response. He hands her a cigarette and lights it for her. They share eye contact as he does this. He then proceeds to light his own.
<br />
<br />There is to be no sexual tension at this point.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Did you catch that fish yet?
<br />
<br />                ROXANNE MOGUL
<br />    Sorry?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    The Hemingway you were reading the other night. Catch that fish?
<br />
<br />                ROXANNE MOGUL
<br />    Oh...
<br />        (pauses to think.)
<br />    He hasn't quite caught it yet. He hasn't given it a reason to leave the water yet.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    And what reason do you think would suffice?
<br />
<br />                ROXANNE MOGUL
<br />    I'm not sure, but it better be good. The fish has to leave everything it knows, the water, and enter a whole new world beyond that.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    What if the old man can force it out?
<br />
<br />                ROXANNE MOGUL
<br />    No. Wouldn't work. Only way he'll be content is if he can convince this fish to leave the water. The fish wants to leave but it just needs an excuse.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />        (Smiling)
<br />    What do you think I am Roxanne?
<br />
<br />                ROXANNE MOGUL
<br />    I think you're the old man.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    I don't strike you as another fish?
<br />
<br />                ROXANNE MOGUL
<br />    Not like these other men.
<br />
<br />She motions to the men at the bar.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    So what do you know about me that I don't seem to know?
<br />
<br />                ROXANNE MOGUL
<br />    I don't know, but I'm just the fish looking for an excuse to get out the water.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    What's in the water that you want to get out?
<br />
<br />                ROXANNE MOGUL
<br />    This life. Crime.
<br />
<br />Royce is has a slight disappointing look on his face as he thought she was flirting.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    I'm in this life just as much as you are Roxanne, I can't pull you out of the water when I'm in it myself.
<br />
<br />                ROXANNE MOGUL
<br />    See, that's where I think you're lying to me. I don't think you're in this life. I lied to myself for a while saying that I wasn't in this life but
<br />
<br />                ROXANNE MOGUL (CONT'D)
<br />    eventually I had to come to terms with the fact that I married into it.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    I'm new. Does that answer your question?
<br />
<br />                ROXANNE MOGUL
<br />        (Smiling)
<br />    No.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Well, if we were to plan your rescue mission out of this life, where would we start?
<br />
<br />                ROXANNE MOGUL
<br />    Well, you'd have to kill my husband first.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Oh, not a happy marriage then?
<br />
<br />She smiles. Then puffs her cigarette and puts it out in the ashtray.
<br />
<br />                ROXANNE MOGUL
<br />    Do you find me attractive Royce?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />        (Surprised)
<br />    Ummm...
<br />
<br />                ROXANNE MOGUL
<br />    That's okay you don't have to...
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Yes I do.
<br />
<br />                ROXANNE MOGUL
<br />        (pauses and smiles for a moment)
<br />    Okay. Why?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Why do you want to know?
<br />
<br />She smiles, waits a moment and continues.
<br />
<br />                ROXANNE MOGUL
<br />    You're a child of divorce, aren't you?
<br />
<br />Royce sits back in his chair and is taken back by the phrase.
<br />
<br />                ROXANNE MOGUL
<br />    I can tell cause you have a smooth demeanour, like you know how to carry yourself, but in the right way. Not the way these guys do it in here. Children of divorce learn that quick cause they loose something they can't get back; security in those closest to them.
<br />        (pauses)
<br />    You're young too, you must have had some time to practice all this so I assume something went wrong in the house early on.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    My dad left when I was 12.
<br />
<br />                ROXANNE MOGUL
<br />        (Smiling)
<br />    I was 16.
<br />        (Long awkward pause)
<br />    So, what have you learned about me since I sat down? Time to summurise cause I'm leaving soon and I haven't decided if you're coming with me.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    I know you want out.
<br />
<br />                ROXANNE MOGUL
<br />    You know that cause I told you. But you're yet to hear anything between those lines.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    What?
<br />
<br />                ROXANNE MOGUL
<br />    Take me out of the water Royce. You're not a bad man, like these guys here. Hell, you're the first person to even listen to me talk. I want you to take me out of the water.
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />        (Thinks for a moment)
<br />    Where do you want me to take you?
<br />
<br />                ROXANNE MOGUL
<br />        (pauses)
<br />    I know you starred at me the other night, I know because it was more than just a stare of sexual desire, it wasn't even lustful in any way. You starred at me the way a musician hears a song; the way a poet feels the pen; the way a fighter feels the pain. It shook you to the core. I'm not arrogant in saying I'm the best you've ever seen, I'm merely telling you how you looked at me.
<br />        (Pause)
<br />    I want you to take me anywhere and look at me like that once more. At least then I know I lived my life with some purpose.
<br />        (another pause)
<br />    Don't collude this statement with any sexuality, I'm strictly pragmatic. I just appreciate the way you looked at me.
<br />
<br />Long pause. The camera slowly zooms out to include both characters in the frame.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    I can't kill your husband Roxanne.
<br />
<br />She sits back in her chair disappointed.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO (CONT'D)
<br />    It's not for me to do. Killing your husband won't free you, it'll only keep you in the water.
<br />
<br />She smiles. Royce puts out his cigarette in the ash tray.
<br />
<br />                ROXANNE MOGUL
<br />    Is that all Mr Royce? Is it my time to go?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />        (Said in a gentle manner)
<br />    No, I think it would be wise if you wait, happy hour is yet to start.
<br />
<br />He smiles and she returns the smile.
<br />
<br />                ROXANNE MOGUL
<br />    Well, in that case I think it would be appropriate if I stay.
<br />        (pause)
<br />    Or we can try out another place, somewhere less... familiar.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Well, will anyone else be joining us then?
<br />
<br />                ROXANNE MOGUL
<br />    Drinks are always more interesting in intimate settings Mr Dario.
<br />
<br />The two get up and walk out the bar. Royce is still holding the backpack given to him by Harry.
<br />
<br />
<br />INT./EXT. CAR - 10AM - NEXT DAY
<br />
<br />Jimmy is in a parked car across from a building. He is smoking a cigarette and has glasses on. From across the street he sees Royce come out of the building with Roxanne, hop in a car and drive off.
<br />
<br />Jimmy hops out of the car and walks over to the building. He is swift as he only has a few hours left to kill Royce. The front door was left open. Jimmy checks the registry for where Royce lives. Apartment 2C.
<br />
<br />INT. ROYCE'S BUILDING - DAY
<br />
<br />Jimmy walks up the stairs and to the door of Royce's apartment. The door is locked.
<br />
<br />Jimmy tests the door and then walks towards the window near the door. He opens the window and steps out onto the ledge and shimmy's over to a window into the apartment. He smashes the window pane and gets into the apartment. He's in the toilet. He starts searching the apartment and finds Royce's police badge.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />        (looking at the badge)
<br />    Well shit.
<br />
<br />He continues looking around and finds the TV Remote. He turns on the TV. There's and advert on about a brand of suits called "Callington's Tailor". Then a program about fishing comes on. The show is called "Ray's Big Fish for Big Men".
<br />
<br />There is a jump in time showing the fishing show ending. Jimmy hears a car pull up and sees that it's Royce. He gets prepared and goes to grab his gun and realises it's not there.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY (CONT'D)
<br />    Oh shit! Fuck!
<br />
<br />He looks out the window and sees Royce enter about to enter the building. He quickly runs out the apartment at the front door and returns to a normal pace as he walks down the stairs. The two pass each other.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    G'day
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    How's it going?
<br />
<br />They continue their ways.
<br />
<br />EXT. ROYCE'S BUILDING - DAY
<br />
<br />Jimmy proceeds to exit the building and walk to his car where he stays seated. Jimmy lights up a cigarette and turns on the radio. It plays in the background and as the camera switches between a tight shot of Jimmy's eyes and an over the shoulder shot of Jimmy looking towards the broken window of Royce's apartment.
<br />
<br />The same advertisement of Joe's Cutting Lounge appears over the radio. The radio then starts playing "Fight" by Adam Miller. This music begins to increase in volume.
<br />
<br />Jimmy watches as Royce walks out the building with a duffel bag and a backpack. He opens the boot and throws the duffel bag into it. Then he proceeds to close the boot and run to the front of the car, opening the door and throwing the backpack onto the passenger seat.
<br />
<br />Royce begins to drive and Jimmy follows him. The camera is now facing Jimmy, looking into the car from the hood. It cuts multiple times, Jimmy is sitting in a new position each time, to show the passing of time. After a few of these he hears thunder and looks up into the sky out of the front windshield. Camera proceeds to again cut multiple times to different seating positions.
<br />
<br />Jimmy passes a paddock of cows and stares at them as he drives past, they stare at him too. After a few more camera cuts, Jimmy sees Royce stop at an intersection a 500m ahead of him.
<br />
<br />They are in the middle of nowhere now, rural Victoria.
<br />
<br />Jimmy begins to speed up and crashes directly into the back of Royce's car at a high speed. Jimmy is now covered a bit in his blood. He steps out of the car. Royce steps out too, Royce is covered in his own blood too.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    What the Fuck!? What kinda shit was all that? I should have your fucking head on a stake!
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />        (Acting a little drunk)
<br />    Woah, look, I'm sorry about the whole thing, I might've had a few too many, also, you can't stop in middle of the fucking road like that.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    It's a fucking intersection you cocksucker! Oh I'm so fucked. I'm so fucked.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Hey mate, let's go inside here and clean ourselves up a bit. I have insurance so don't stress too much mate.
<br />
<br />There is a pub next to the site of the crash.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Okay, okay. Let's get this blood handled.
<br />
<br />The two of them walk together towards the shop and enter. The camera follows them the whole time with a long-shot. They walk through the building into the bathroom and wash off the blood.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    So, you from round here or just visiting?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Not the time mate.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Woah! Just thought I'd try and sooth the hostility a bit.
<br />
<br />They start walking back and don't say anything to each other. Jimmy walks to the passenger side of his car while Royce leans through the window of his car.
<br />
<br />Jimmy pulls out a cricket bat (has to be English Willow). Royce is looking away into his car. Jimmy walks up towards him with the bat.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Aye! Mate!
<br />
<br />Royce turns around and Jimmy knocks him out with a single swing.
<br />
<br />
<br />INT. MOGUL'S OFFICE - MORNING - EARLIER THAT DAY
<br />
<br />Mogul is sitting in his chair, he is a shrewd man of about 60 years. With him sits two of his advisors. The room is poorly lit, and filled with the smoke from cigarettes. Mogul looks as if he could stand to lose some wight, but he isn't overweight to the point where it is unhealthy.
<br />
<br />                MOGUL
<br />    Okay, it's risky... this is waging war, and it won't go down without blood.
<br />
<br />                ADVISOR #1
<br />    Well, we recommend using Royce, he's new, lotta' people won't recognize him as a Mogul. We'll make it look like it was just an individual acting in total anarchy.
<br />
<br />                ADVISOR #2
<br />    The Spinks will still blame us, but nonetheless, this "act of war" will put us in front.
<br />
<br />                MOGUL
<br />    So what do we do with him once we got him?
<br />
<br />                ADVISOR #1
<br />    Well, he has vital information in relation to the fights and the punting. We recommend you torture him for the information, then either hold him for ransom or kill him completely.
<br />
<br />                MOGUL
<br />    I see. I want to speak with him personally. Bring him to a remote location, once he is stable I'll join the party. I want to be the one who kills him.
<br />
<br />                ADVISOR #2
<br />    Sir, after that, it would be wise to give up Ryoyce as the person who kidnapped him. We'll call it collateral.
<br />
<br />                MOGUL
<br />    Okay, get Royce on the phone. I want it to happen today. Oh before I forget, Cobbs?
<br />
<br />                ADVISOR #1
<br />    He's been handled sir.
<br />
<br />Camera cuts to Harry Cobbs tied by the neck to a car chair. One of the Advisors puts the car into neutral and pushes the car down a hill. It travels for about 200m before hitting a tree at the end of the road hard. Harry is dead. Camera cuts back to the office.
<br />
<br />                MOGUL
<br />    Okay, that's good. Where's the fucking phone at already!?
<br />
<br />One of the advisors hands him a phone already ringing. Camera cuts to Royce's apartment. He is leaning on a wall and over is shoulder, out of focus, you can see Roxanne standing.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />        (speaking into the phone)
<br />    Okay, I understand.
<br />        (pauses; Mogul is talking)
<br />    I'll be right on it then sir.
<br />
<br />He hangs up the phone.
<br />
<br />                ROXANNE MOGUL
<br />    Who was that?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Your husband...
<br />
<br />                ROXANNE MOGUL
<br />        (Slightly anxious)
<br />    He knows?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    No.
<br />
<br />                ROXANNE MOGUL
<br />    Well, what is it then?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    He wants me to kidnap and torture Spinks.
<br />
<br />                ROXANNE MOGUL
<br />    Are you allowed to do that? I thought you can't do any illegal activity?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    I'll drop you off at your house then I'll suss it with my superiors.
<br />
<br />                ROXANNE MOGUL
<br />    Okay, I think it would be wise if you drop me off at my sisters. I'll call him to pick me up and tell him my sister needed company for the night.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Okay, but we gotta go now cause Mogul wants it done today.
<br />
<br />The two of them leave the building in a rush. Get into Royce's car and drive off.
<br />
<br />The camera makes a quick pan of the car traveling from Royce's building to the police station.
<br />
<br />Royce is next seen walking through the offices of the police station.
<br />
<br />EXT. POLICE STATION - MORNING
<br />
<br />Man #3 is seen in focus but isn't given any attention. He is sitting on a chair handcuffed to it being questioned by the police. Royce walks up to Police #1 and talks to them.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    We have an issue, and we gotta make this quick.
<br />
<br />Camera then cuts straight into the office of the Sergeant, with him, Police #1 and Royce all in the room alone.
<br />
<br />                SERGEANT
<br />    I'm pretty sure that's out of your ability. I don't know if we can grant any warrant allowing us to do anything like this.
<br />
<br />                POLICE #1
<br />    Sir, if he denies we risk the whole operation.
<br />
<br />                SERGEANT
<br />    See, I might as well pull the plug on the whole thing cause we've already lost one man.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    What? Who'd we fucking lose?
<br />
<br />                SERGEANT
<br />    Harry.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    What? How'd that fucking happen?
<br />
<br />                POLICE #1
<br />    We don't know. We found him in a car hugging a tree a tad too tight.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Shit!
<br />
<br />                POLICE #1
<br />    What's the action then sir?
<br />
<br />                SERGEANT
<br />    Have we got anything on Spinks? I mean absolutly anything? I'm talking petty crime, maybe he J-walked.
<br />
<br />                POLICE #1
<br />    Well, we can place him at the illegal fights with the testimony of Royce.
<br />
<br />                SERGEANT
<br />    Okay, that'll do. I'll apply for an arrest warrant, something like that is bound to come through. I'll give you the signal when you have the green light. Now you're going to have to be slightly unethical in making sure you don't blow any cover.
<br />
<br />                POLICE #1
<br />    The arrest wouldn't suffice in court, it'll be an unlawful arrest but... We can tell the DPP to not pursue charges for anything to do with involvement of the illegal fights, that way we can arrest him again... and lawfully for harder crimes with the testimony of Royce.
<br />
<br />                SERGEANT
<br />    Exactly.
<br />EXT. SPINKS'S HOUSE - MORNING
<br />
<br />Camera cuts to Jimmy pulling up to the house of Spinks. Spinks's house is a nice, double story home with a pool in the back. The house is in a upper-class neighborhood.
<br />
<br />Royce hops out the car and walks around the front yard for sometime looking for a way to get into the house without making any noise. He has no plan as to how he is going to get in so he looks somewhat clueless. He tries opening windows, climbing up some walls to get to a balcony.
<br />
<br />Eventually he gives up and walks over to the door to look through the window. He tests the door handle and the door is open. There is a look of surprise on Royce's face; he's thinking "no fucking way that worked".
<br />
<br />He slowly opens the door, it creeks once, he stops opening and slowly begins again after a pause. It doesn't creek anymore.
<br />
<br />Royce begins to slowly walk down the hallway with gun in hand. He paces slowly. When he reaches the end of the hallway the camera is facing his face to not show what is in the room at the end of the hallway.
<br />
<br />On Royce's face is a slight expression showing some comfortability in the situation (the actor can choose how this exact facial expression looks, but it is minimal and reveals no emotion like excitement, happiness, anger etc. Just a movement of the face). He lowers is gun slightly to lower his guard when he makes this expression and then lifts it up again.
<br />
<br />The camera pans slowly 180 degrees around Royce's body. From the end of the hallway he is ficing slightly to his right on an angle. The camera pans right around him slowly so that it is looking over his left shoulder.
<br />
<br />In this view we see a chair facing away from Royce. The chair is a comfortable sitting chair. The man in the chair is clearly listening to music as he moves his hands in time with the song the audience can't hear, he is wearing headphones.
<br />
<br />The room that they are situated in looks out into the backyard with a view of the pool. As Royce is walking over to the man in the chair, unsure if it is Spinks or not, he notices someone in the pool on an inflatable couch.
<br />
<br />Royce manages to dientify the man in the pool as Spinks. There is a quick zoom towards the gun that is seated in the lap of Spinks in the pool. Spinks also has headphones on but he is listening to an audio book of 
<br />The Old Man and the Sea.
<br />Royce then sees the gun on the coffee table next to the man listening to music. Royce slowly creeps over and crouches behind the chair.
<br />
<br />He carefully takes the gun and puts it in his belt behind him. He then proceeds to apply a rear naked choke to the man in the chair, knocking him unconscious quickly without any noise.
<br />
<br />Royce then drags the man over into a nearby door; a separate room. He ties a gag around the mouth of the victim. Royce uses the tie of the man to gag him. He then pulls out handcuffs from behind him and handcuffs the man to something (use anything available in the house that works, can be any inanimate object that is held fast to the floor).
<br />
<br />Royce then looks out to the pool as he enters the previous room again. He thinks for a moment as to how to approach Spinks without potentially getting shot.
<br />
<br />He looks over to the kitchen and sees the toaster in focus. Camera cuts so that it is in a cupboard looking out. Royce opens the cupboard doors, the camera pans down to reveal an extension lead.
<br />
<br />Camera cuts to Royce standing poolside, Spinks is unaware as he has his eyes closed. In his hand, Royce has the toaster, he is holding it so that it is above the water. If Royce is shot by Spinks, the toaster will most likely fall into the water. In the other hand is Royce's gun. The camera has a close up of the red glow coming from the wire inside the toaster.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Hey! Spinks.
<br />
<br />Spinks doesn't notice.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO (CONT'D)
<br />    Hey!
<br />
<br />Spinks doesn't notice again. Royce then slightly splashes Spinks. It is essential that the splash is only light, so as to not have a huge reaction from Spinks, this splash is merely to gain his attention and not alert him in any way.
<br />
<br />Spinks then opens his eyes and looks towards Royce. He takes off the headphones.
<br />
<br />Royces motions to the gun and directs his head so that it is clear Spinks must throw the gun away. Spinks does exactly that. Spinks is in his speedos.
<br />
<br />Camera cuts to Spinks lying on the pavement of the front driveway in his speedos. Duck tape is around his ankles, wrists are taped together behind his back and his mouth has been taped over.
<br />
<br />Royce then begins to walk away from Spinks to go to his car. He reverses his car all the way up the driveway to where Spinks is. He gets out the car and sees that Spinks isn't there where he left him.
<br />
<br />Camera cuts to a street, the camera facing houses so that it is looking across the street. Spinks then enters the frame from the left and is jumping like a kangaroo.
<br />
<br />Camera changes to a front on frame and sees Spinks jumping away. In the background, out of focus, Royce's car leaves the driveway and chases after Spinks.
<br />
<br />The car isn't going incredibly fast, maybe 40km/hr. As it gets to Spinks the camera changes to within the vehicle looking out the front windshield. Spinks sightly jumps upon impact to reduce damage but he is hit by the car and falls to the ground unconscious.
<br />
<br />EXT. ROYCE'S BUILDING - MIDDAY
<br />
<br />Royce pulls up to the building. He appears to be alone in the car but Spinks is in the boot of the car. Royce gets out. There is a longshot as Royce walks into the building and up the stairs. As he is walking up the stairs, Jimmy is walking down.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    G'day
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    How's it going?
<br />
<br />Royce then continues up the stairs into his apartment. He walks into the living room and notices the TV is on but isn't phased by it.
<br />
<br />He grabs a duffel bag lying on the living room floor. He continues looking around the house. He finds a reel of duct-ape. He finds some length of rope. He finds a pair of bolt cutters. He looks at the pair of bolt cutters and then nods as if to say "yeah, might as well take these". Finally he puts in bleach from underneath his kitchen sink.
<br />
<br />Royce then sees the backpack given to him by Harry, he grabs it and puts it on his back. He takes the duffel bag and exits the apartment.
<br />
<br />He continues down the stairs and out of the apartment. He then goes to his car and opens the boot, the camera sees Spinks in the boot who has now regained consciousness. Royce throws the duffel bag at him.
<br />
<br />The camera then looks up at him from an angle as he closes the boot of the car. This is to look like the opening scene from Goodfellas.
<br />
<br />He then gets into the drivers seat and starts the car. He drives off.
<br />
<br />INT./EXT. CAR (RURAL VICTORIA) - AFTERNOON
<br />
<br />Royce stops the car at an intersection and looks both ways. He puts the car into park and begins to search around the car for some cigarettes. The camera is looking at him from the passenger seat of the car.
<br />
<br />After about 10 seconds of searching he finally finds them. He puts one in his mouth then proceeds to look for the lighter. Again finding it he lights up.
<br />
<br />Complete silence except for the sound of the cigarette burning as he inhales. There is a close up of the end of the cigarette as it glows.
<br />
<br />There is a pause for a few seconds. Royce then goes to puff again.
<br />
<br />Finally he reaches to his mouth one last time. Just before the cigarette reaches his mouth there is a violent crash from the impact of Jimmy's car.
<br />
<br />The airbag goes off. Royce is now covered in his blood. There is a high frequency ringing as we are in the subjective view of Royce as he experiences a slight concussion.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Fuck! Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit.
<br />
<br />He gathers himself. The camera is still in the position of the passenger looking towards Royce. Royce gets out of the car.
<br />
<br />The screen fades back.
<br />
<br />The moment before the impact of Jimmy's car is purposely extrapolated and longer than what we experience from the subjective view of Jimmy earlier.
<br />
<br />This is because Jimmy is fuming with adrenaline, time and speed seem very subliminal. Royce, however, is calm and relaxed, so time appears as normal. Keep the audience in suspense for as long as possible without making it too unrealistic.
<br />
<br />Take your time with this scene. This is the bomb under Alfred Hitchcock's table, use it wisely.
<br />
<br />
<br />EXT. THE BUSH - 1PM
<br />
<br />The scene opens as Royce regains consciousness. He is tied to a tree and they're located in what looks like a paddock. There are mountains surrounding them.
<br />
<br />Royce is tied so that he is sitting with his back up against the tree. Jimmy is leaning on Royce's car, waiting for Royce to wake up. Jimmy is holding a handgun.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Welcome back.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    You fucking idiot.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    I'm sorry, excuse me? You should be slightly more thankful, I'm supposed to kill you but I kept you alive to ask you something.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    And what is that?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    You're a fucking cop, aren't you?
<br />
<br />Royce as a confused expression on his face. Then a moment of slight realisation.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    You were at my building this morning!
<br />
<br />Jimmy nods and smiles.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO (CONT'D)
<br />    You left my fucking TV on and everything.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Look, I haven't got anything else to ask and you took longer than I expected to wake up. I only have an hour left to kill you so I'm not wasting anytime.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Wait! Fucking wait.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    For what?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Who's paying you?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Well, what the hell, I'll tell you. Spinks.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Has he paid you yet?
<br />
<br />Jimmy has a slight confused but intrigued expression.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Are you making a counter offer?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    No, Spinks is dead. If he hasn't already paid you, you're not getting any money.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    What the fuck do you mean he's dead? I fucking saw him yesterday!
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Mogul fucking wanted me to kidnap Spinks to beat some info out of him.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    And you killed him?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Nope. You killed him.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    What the fuck do you mean?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    He was in the boot of my car when you rear ended me you fucking dumbass!
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Bullshit.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Check yourself dickhead, You drove my fucking car here for some reason.
<br />
<br />Jimmy begins walking.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    My car wouldn't start after the crash.
<br />
<br />Jimmy walks to the rear end of the car and starts trying to open the boot of the car.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    You gotta pull the lever under the drivers seat!
<br />
<br />Jimmy walks to the front of the car and pulls the lever. He walks to the back again and attempts opening. He pulls for some time and struggles before giving up.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    It's not fucking opening!
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Fold the back seats forward then! You can get into the boot that way.
<br />
<br />Jimmy nods and walks to the door passenger and opens it. He pulls the lever lowering the passenger seats. Spinks' mangled body falls right in front Jimmy. The body is so disfigured but it is possible to identify the man as Spinks.
<br />
<br />Jimmy falls back as he sees the body of Spinks. The camera shows the shock on his face. Realisation dawns upon Jimmy as he knows he is going to die.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    You gonna release me now? There's no one fucking paying you now.
<br />
<br />Jimmy gets up and Royce notices the shock on his face.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO (CONT'D)
<br />    What?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    We're fucked.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    What!?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    We are fucked, that's exactly what we are.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    What are you saying?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    I only had a day to kill you, if I didn't do that a bounty would automatically be placed on my head, and the money on your head would increase.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    So are you going to kill me?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    There's no point.
<br />
<br />Jimmy walks over to Royce and unties him.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY (CONT'D)
<br />    The system is automated, Spinks puts in a key code when the job is done which prevents the bounties being put on our heads.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    So now a whole bunch of people are coming after us now?
<br />
<br />Jimmy nods.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Oh fuck.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    You're a fucking cop though, you can get backup.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Do you have my phone?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    No I threw it away.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    What about yours?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    There's no connection out here.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Look, even if i could get in contact
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO (CONT'D)
<br />    with the police, we would both be arrested.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Oh.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Kidnapping Spinks was kinda off the books. Now that he's dead, I'm eligible for a charge of constructive murder. I'm not fucking taking that.
<br />
<br />Royce stands up as he is now fully untied.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    So what's the fucking plan?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    I don't know.
<br />
<br />Pause.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO (CONT'D)
<br />    Where are the guns I had?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    They're in the car.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    All three?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Yup.
<br />
<br />Pause.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY (CONT'D)
<br />    Spinks has a tracker on him at all times.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    What?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    I just remembered.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    So not only does your gang know that Spinks has been kidnapped, but they know exactly where he is.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Yup.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    So they're coming after us.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Yeah, they'll most likely reach us first.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Do they know you're here? You don't have any tracking do you?
<br />
<br />Jimmy shakes his head in response.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO (CONT'D)
<br />    Okay good. How many do you think they'll send?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    They'll send their own contractors. Plus a few goons.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Okay.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    So?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Cops can't help us. I could call up the Moguls and see if that works.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Do you know anyone's number.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    I know one. Let's find a payphone.
<br />INT. MOGUL'S OFFICE - SAME TIME AS THE CRASH
<br />
<br />Mogul is in his office an advisor and the man seen from the police station. Roxanne is seated in the back of the office.
<br />
<br />                MOGUL
<br />    You sure it was him you saw?
<br />
<br />                MAN #3
<br />    Yes sir, I recognized him straight away.
<br />
<br />                MOGUL
<br />    What was he doing?
<br />
<br />                MAN #3
<br />    He walked into an office with another police officer.
<br />
<br />                ADVISOR #1
<br />    How long was he in there?
<br />
<br />                MAN #3
<br />    Not long, maybe ten minutes. He was then in a rush to leave.
<br />
<br />                MOGUL
<br />    What time was this?
<br />
<br />                MAN #3
<br />    10 or 11.
<br />
<br />Mogul looks to his advisor.
<br />
<br />                MOGUL
<br />    Right about the time we called him. Would he be undercover?
<br />
<br />                ADVISOR #1
<br />    It's unlikely he's an informant cause he is new to the gang.
<br />
<br />                MOGUL
<br />    Undercover?
<br />
<br />The advisor nods his head.
<br />
<br />                ADVISOR #1
<br />    We just got word that Spinks has placed money on his head too.
<br />
<br />                MOGUL
<br />    Hmmm...
<br />        (thinks for a moment)
<br />    Let Spinks deal with him. If that doesn't work I want him dead.
<br />
<br />Roxanne looks slightly anxious but she is trying to hide it.
<br />
<br />EXT. RURAL MOTEL PAYPHONE - 2PM - SAME DAY
<br />
<br />Camera opens with Royce on the phone. He is speaking calmy and softly.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    They know?
<br />
<br />                ROXANNE MOGUL
<br />    Yes, some guy of theirs saw you inside the police station.
<br />
<br />Royce puts his hand on his head as he thinks of what to do.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Okay, I don't want to get you inolved. Be ready to leave tonight, I'll be at your house. If I'm not there by midnight... you should leave without me.
<br />
<br />                ROXANNE MOGUL
<br />        (pauses)
<br />    How do you want me waiting?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    However you want, obviously don't make Mogul aware of this. I gotta go now.
<br />
<br />                ROXANNE MOGUL
<br />    Okay. Bye.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Bye.
<br />
<br />They hang up the phone. Royce walks out of the motel outside where Jimmy is sitting in the car.
<br />
<br />Royce leans through the open window of the passenger side of the car.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO (CONT'D)
<br />    The Moguls know.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Know what?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    They know I'm a cop, they don't know that Spinks is dead though. Dunno if anyone is aware he's kidnapped yet.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Ah Fuck! So no help from them then?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Looks that way.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    I reckon we take Spinks as bait to somewhere we know, have time to prepare for them coming.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    What did you have in mind?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    I dunno, where are we?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    We're in Dargo.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Okay, I'd say we probably have about two hours before they get here.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    I know an old farmer out 'ere, that's where I was gonna take Spinks.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    You know the place well?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Used to go there as a kid, I know the place fairly well.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    How would he actually feel about us bringing hail fire to his property?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    For all I know he's dead, property hasn't been touched in years I'm pretty sure.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    How far is it from here?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Bout an hour by dirt road.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    He got any guns there?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Maybe. I reckon it's our best shot though. It's either this or dump the body and run the rest of our lives.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    As soon as people find out Spinks is dead, bounty hunters won't be after us anymore. We'll just need to get rid of the ones thirsty for revenge.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Sounds doable. We'll still have cops on our tails for a while but at least they aren't trying to kill us.
<br />INT./EXT. CAR - 2PM - MOVING
<br />
<br />Scene opens looking at the two of them together in the car driving. Jimmy is driving. It starts off with silence as the two don't talk. Royce breaks the silence.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    So how long have you been in this business?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    About four days.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Oh wow, short lived aye.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />        (Chuckles)
<br />    Yeah, seems so. How about you? how long you been a cop?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Only been out of the acadamy for a year. This is my first undercover case.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Oh yeah, how long have you been working the case?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Started last night.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Oh wow. So last night was your first
<br />
<br />                JIMMY (CONT'D)
<br />    fight?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Well, I mean, I've been in fights before.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Oh yeah. Everyone was pretty impressed you won.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Fuck, me too man. I felt like shit for some reason.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Oh shit I forgot, Spinks spiked your AD with heroin.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Really? No clue how people get addicted to that shit then.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />        (Chuckles)
<br />    Neither.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    I was paranoid for like four hours after that. Had night sweats and everything.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />        (Laughing)
<br />    Oh shit.
<br />        (Pauses)
<br />    Oh I almost forgot to ask. Did you bone Mogul's wife?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />        (Laughs)
<br />    What makes you say that?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    I saw you run out of your building this morning with her. I just recognised her.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Nah I didn't have sex with her. I couldn't bring myself to do it.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Why's that?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    I mean, well, firstly it's someone elses wife. Secondly, that could've been really bad for the whole undercover operation.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    So why'd she stay at your house?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    She didn't want to go home basically.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Fair enough.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    What do you reckon our odds are? Of living that is.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Honestly, no clue man. I hadn't killed anyone until four days ago.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Right.
<br />        (pause)
<br />    I've never killed anyone.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />        (surprised)
<br />    Really?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Nup.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Oh you're going to love it.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    You reckon?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Yeah man! Everyone you meet makes murder sound like it's no fun but it's rivtting stuff.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    How many people have you killed then?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Hmmm, maybe 13, I think.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    In four days!?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Yeah, seems a tad excessive upon reflection.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Wait, were you he guy who killed everyone at the Bank?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Yeah that was me!
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    No shit, I was there that night!
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Oh there you go.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Oh! Left here.
<br />EXT. THE FARM - 3PM
<br />
<br />The sun is blazing hot. Camera focuses on some inanimate objects around the farm house to set the tone of the rest of the movie.
<br />
<br />The car arrives on the grass outside the farmhouse. The two get out and see the house.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    No one's home you reckon?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Shouldn't be.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Cool.
<br />
<br />The two of them search around the house for some time looking for a way inside. Eeventually Jimmy just tries to open the door and it works; the door wasn't locked.
<br />
<br />Ryoce joins him at the door and they walk inside together.
<br />
<br />INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Look around to see what we've got.
<br />
<br />Royce comes around and joins Jimmy in the house. The two start looking around the place to see what they have on hand. Royce starts looking in the kitchen cupboards. Jimmy is looking in the living room looking at old music cd's.
<br />
<br />Jimmy eventually walks over to cupboard and opens it. The camera cuts to a shot from within the cupboard looking at Jimmy's face. He is surprised by the contents. The camera doesn't show what's in it.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Royce, come check this out.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Yeah?
<br />
<br />Royce finishes up in the kitchen and walks to the cupboard joining Jimmy.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO (CONT'D)
<br />    Oh, shit.
<br />
<br />Camera now shows the handful of hunting rifles in the cupboard.
<br />
<br />EXT. THE FARM - DAY
<br />
<br />Jimmy is outside in a paddock with the farmhouse in the background. He is looking out into the fields and mountains and thinking about what they should do.
<br />
<br />Jimmy lights up a cigarette and begins to smoke it. There is a loud noise from inside the house.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />        (from afar)
<br />    Ah! Fuck!
<br />
<br />Jimmy isn't phased and continues smoking while a takes a seat in the long grass. He opens his water canister and takes a drink.
<br />
<br />Jimmy places his cigarette into the dirt with the stub in the ground so noting cathes fire. He then continues to pull out some crackers from his pocket and begins to eat them earnestly as he is hungry.
<br />
<br />He sips on his water while he does this.
<br />
<br />The crackling of a small fire is heard and Jimmy looks down next to him to see the chaos his burning cigarette has caused.
<br />
<br />There is a small grass fire.
<br />
<br />Jimmy jumps up in surprise ang begins to stamp it out with his foot but it doesn't work.
<br />
<br />He then tips his whole bottle of water on it.
<br />
<br />He stands still for some time and looks around to see if Royce noticed the chaotic event.
<br />
<br />Jimmy puts the canister away in his pocket and proceeds to light up another cigarette.
<br />
<br />He then walks back to the house. On his way he places his canister in the car. The body of Spinks is seen.
<br />
<br />INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY
<br />
<br />Camera cuts a few minutes into the future where Jimmy and Royce have laid out the guns on the table with all the ammo they have.
<br />
<br />The two of them are standing next to each other looking at the several firearms. Jimmy picks up a single round and looks at it; observes it.
<br />
<br />Royce moves to the kitchen. He turns on the tap but no water comes out.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    What time you got?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    3.15.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Which gives us?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    45 minutes maybe.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />        (Pause)
<br />    I'm gonna get some water.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Sure, I'm fucking thirsty, take my bottle, it's in the car.
<br />
<br />Royce nods as he picks up a hunting rifle and puts it over his shoulder.
<br />
<br />EXT. THE FARM - DAY
<br />
<br />He leaves the house and walks towards the car and reaches through the open window for Jimmy's bottle.
<br />
<br />Royce turns to leave and walks a few steps before pausing, walking back to the car, reach through the window and pick up his bag. He slings the bag over his shoulder.
<br />
<br />As Royce turns around the camera looks directly at him. The focus of the camera changes to the dirt road behind him where a car can be seen driving.
<br />
<br />It is quite far away and Royce doesn't hear it or notice it.
<br />
<br />Camera cuts so that it is watching Royce walk away through a paddock towards a tree line.
<br />
<br />INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY
<br />
<br />Jimmy peers through a window to where the camera saw the car only moments before. The car is no longer there.
<br />
<br />Jimmy sits down at the dining table. He stares at it for a moment looking a all the guns. He quickly takes a handgun and gets up quickly.
<br />
<br />EXT. THE FARM - DAY
<br />
<br />Jimmy quickly runs out to the car and opens the back door, the camera sees the body of Spinks lying there. Jimmy grabs the duffel bag that Royce put in the car. In it he finds the duct-ape he wants.
<br />
<br />INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY
<br />
<br />He walks back inside and crawls under the table. He tapes the handgun to the bottom of the table. He proceeds to do the same with another gun at the other end of the table.
<br />
<br />EXT. FARM RIVER - DAY
<br />
<br />Camera cuts to Royce who has found a river nearby. He walks up to the river bank and puts his gun on the ground. He begins filling up Jimmy's water bottle and proceeds to wash his face.
<br />
<br />Camera cuts to a shot of the house from afar. Stays on this shot for a bit before cutting.
<br />
<br />INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY
<br />
<br />Jimmy is sitting on a couch.
<br />
<br />A bullet flies through the window and hits a wall behind Jimmy.
<br />
<br />EXT. FARM RIVER - DAY
<br />
<br />Camera quickly cuts to Royce standing up quickly and grabbing his gun in response to the sound of the bullet.
<br />
<br />INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY
<br />
<br />Camera cuts back to Jimmy as he gets up out of his chair and runs towards the guns on the table. Another bullet flies through and hits Jimmy in the thigh.
<br />
<br />EXT. THE FARM - DAY
<br />
<br />The camera cuts to reveal a gunman in a paddock from afar.
<br />
<br />Royce is now running towards the house and sees the gunman from afar, Royce is protected by the treeline so he doesn't catch the attention of the gunman.
<br />
<br />He gets low to the ground and begins moving closer to the gunman.
<br />
<br />INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY
<br />
<br />Jimmy is crawling on the floor. His leg is bleeding fast and his right trouser leg is now soaked in blood. Bullets continue to fly through the house.
<br />
<br />EXT. THE FARM - DAY
<br />
<br />Royce is running fast through the treeline. He stops and aims his gun towards the shooter. He fires once and sees the shooter fall to the ground. He begins to run to the shooter.
<br />
<br />After running a considerable distance he stops as he sees the shooter move in the long grass. Royce crouches and aims again. He shoots the gunman once more.
<br />
<br />Royce then walks over and sees the shooter bleeding out in the grass. The shooter is still moving slightly and is in agony.
<br />
<br />Royce aims his gun at him. He stays in this position for a while before owering his gun and sitting down. He's never killed a man before.
<br />
<br />He stays seated looking at the gunman for some time. He is contemplating whether or not to kill the man.
<br />
<br />Royce eventually stands up and aims. He presses the barrel of the gun right to the head of the gunman.
<br />
<br />The camera looks up at Royce as he aims and shoots once more.
<br />
<br />From 30 meters away the camera looks upon the shooting and sees blood fly everywhere.
<br />
<br />INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY
<br />
<br />Camera cuts to Royce walking in the house with two rifles. He sees Jimmy on the floor sitting up at the wall.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Oh shit. How bad is it?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    My leg is fucked man.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Can you walk?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Yeah, but not incredibly well.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Should we fix it up at all? Or are we shy of time?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Uhh...
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Your call man, it's your leg.
<br />
<br />Jimmy nods. Royce stands up and moves to the kitchen.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO (CONT'D)
<br />    I think I saw a first aid kit somewhere in here.
<br />
<br />Royce finds a small bagand a bottle of Vodka and walks over to Jimmy again. Royce pauses as he reaches Jimmy.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    I'll do it.
<br />
<br />Jimmy takes a swig of the vodka and opens the bag. He puts the bag and bottle down and takes his pants off. The wound is bad. Jimmy pours some Vodka and the wound and whinces as he does it.
<br />
<br />Royce walks to the kitchen and gets a cloth. He walks back and hands it to Jimmy. Jimmy cleans the wound and continues to pour vodka on it.
<br />
<br />Jimmy takes a bandage from the small bag and wraps up his leg. Once it is wrapped he puts his pants back on. Royce is seated during this time and watches the whole thing without saying anything.
<br />
<br />Jimmy gets up once his pants are on and sits at the table with Royce. He now has a slow limp.
<br />
<br />There is a long pause before they start talking again.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    What made you do it? Get into this life.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    I guess I just needed a way out of my old life. This was the first oppurtunity that came my way.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    In what form?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />        (He laughs)
<br />    My lawyer.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />        (Smiling)
<br />    Corrupt lawyer?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Corrupt? yes. Lawyer? yes. Corrupt lawyer? No, not really.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Oh yeah?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    He's legit as a lawyer, doesn't break the law or anything in that sense. He just has a side job.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Why did you need to get out of your old life?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Because I was closer to death back then than I am right now, at this very moment.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    And what has the change in lifestyle brought you so far?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />        (Smiling)
<br />    Some good yarns and a karked leg.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />        (Laughing)
<br />    Nothing good come your way aye?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Yeah, I don't think I do crime all that well.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Well you're off to a better start than me.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    What are you going to do when you get home?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    I'm not going home.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    You plan on dying here? Pick a paddock now and we can start digging our graves if you want.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Nah nah nah. There's nothing left for me in that city.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Except Mogul's wife.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />        (Laughing)
<br />    Except Mogul's wife.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    You gonna kill Mogul?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    I think you're starting to confuse me for a criminal.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />        (Smiling)
<br />    Seems that way. What are you going to do? Mogul isn't exactly going to give her to you is he?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Maybe I've romanticised the idea in my head but we're just gonna skip town and move somewhere else.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    She's just gonna run off?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Well, that's the plan.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    I don't mean to shake the feathers but If my wife was taken away by some man, he isn't getting off easily.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    I know I know, I guess it's hard to plan all that considering our circumstances.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    I guess.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    You want any more vodka?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    I don't shoot straight all that well when I've been tossed up well.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Your call.
<br />
<br />Royce gets up and picks the up the bottle on the floor where Jimmy left it. He sits back down and starts taking swigs.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    What's the time?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    3.45.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Should we plan out something perhaps?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    What did you have in mind?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Look, seen as you're a little incapacitated, you should stay here and kill whatever comes through that door.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    You fucking idiots!
<br />
<br />The two of them turn and see Ellis at the door.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING (CONT'D)
<br />    I should fucking kill you both.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Who the fuck are you?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    The lawyer.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    How did you both manage to shit the bed like this? And fucking hell did I see Spinks in speedos in the back of that car there?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    I killed him.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    Now why would you go do something like that?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    I kidnapped him, he was in the boot when Jimmy here hit me in the back.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    Fuck, well that is a grand performance. Well then, now that you have a fuck load of bad people with bad guns coming your way, what's your plan?
<br />
<br />Ellis points a shotgun at the two of them.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING (CONT'D)
<br />    And why should I even help either of you?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Woah! Hold up! Hold up!
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    What the fuck Ellis?
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    There is a lot of money on your head Jimmy so shut up.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Hey! Can I convince you?
<br />
<br />The pitch is yours my friend. Royce begins to get up slowly. The backpack is on the floor near him and he picks it up. He walks over to Ellis and unzips the bag. Ellis looks inside and looks back at Royce.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    Fuck off.
<br />
<br />He looks back into the bag.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING (CONT'D)
<br />        (pauses as he thinks)
<br />    Okay, I'll help you boys. But you listen to me alright.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Probably better than us figuring out the plan.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />        (pointing to Jimmy)
<br />    Right, you look fucked up. Can you walk?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Yeah. Not well but I can walk.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    Right, you stay here and kill anyone that walks through the door.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Oh shit.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />        (pointing to Royce)
<br />    Can you aim well?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    I do alright.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    That'll have to do. Go up into those hills over there and kill anybody you can see.
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    Cool beans.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    I'll scout the paddocks and see what I can do. But first, I gotta shit so where's the toilet?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    It's just outside.
<br />
<br />                ELLIS REDDING
<br />    Right, I'll drop the kids off at the pool then I'm on my way.
<br />
<br />Ellis leaves the room with his shotgun.
<br />
<br />Royce begins to pick up a rifle and picks up the bag.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Hey, Royce, what happens to us after this?
<br />
<br />                ROYCE DARIO
<br />    There is no us Jimmy.
<br />
<br />Royce walks out the door, Jimmy walks out with him and calls out again.

<br />    Hey!
<br />
<br />Royce turns around.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY (CONT'D)
<br />    Shoot straight.
<br />
<br />Royce nods and turns to walk away. Jimmy walks back into the house.
<br />
<br />INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY
<br />
<br />He stops in the doorway and the camera is looking at him face on.
<br />
<br />The camera then pans right around him 180 degrees and rests in an over the shoulder shot of Jo-Ji sitting at the other end of the dining table.
<br />
<br />                JO-JI
<br />    Hi there friend, please take a seat.
<br />
<br />Jo is holding a handgun towards Jimmy. Jimmy slowly sits downat the end of the table. The camera cuts to under the table and sees jimmy trying to slowly peel the tape without making any noise.
<br />
<br />                JO-JI (CONT'D)
<br />    Was that Spinks I saw in the car over there?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Yup.
<br />
<br />                JO-JI
<br />    Why's he naked?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    He's got speedos on.
<br />
<br />                JO-JI
<br />    My question remains.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    I'm not sure why he's in speedos.

<br />Camera cuts to Royce running up a hill through trees before cutting to Ellis on the toilet.
<br />
<br />INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY
<br />
<br />                JO-JI
<br />    Now, Jimmy, I really liked you. I actually had a few fantasies involving you but that hasn't seem to warp my loaylty to Spinks I'm afraid.
<br />
<br />She shoots him in the shoulder.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Ah! Fuck!
<br />
<br />                JO-JI
<br />    It's a shame you had to take this path, We could've been a great crime fighting couple.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Jo, I don't know what the fuck you were thinking but there was nothing here.
<br />
<br />                JO-JI
<br />    One more reason for me to kill you I guess.
<br />
<br />Camera cuts to underneath the table. Jimmy has now peeled the tape completely off and has the gun.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Who are you?
<br />
<br />                JO-JI
<br />    A confused girl it seems.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    You know you don't have to kill me, I've got two wounds already, both of which are bleeding out profusly. Wouldn't your saddist mind prefer to watch that instead.
<br />
<br />                JO-JI
<br />    You're actually right!
<br />EXT. THE FARM - DAY
<br />
<br />Camera cuts to a sniper walking in the woods. They get down and can see the house from afar. They begin to aim down the scope.

<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    I am?
<br />
<br />                JO-JI
<br />    Yeah, have you ever seen a man go cold before?
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    No, I have not.
<br />
<br />                JO-JI
<br />    Well, like I said, you get all cold first and disorientated. Dizzy.
<br />EXT. THE FARM - DAY
<br />
<br />Camera cuts to the sniper. He is aiming right at Jimmy but Jimmy keeps moving and twitching so as to not allow the sniper for a clean shot.
<br />

<br />
<br />                JO-JI (CONT'D)
<br />    Once the loss of red blood cells exceeds the production of red blood cells your body enters a state of anemia. Not fun.
<br />
<br />Jimmy begins sweatinig.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />        (Smiling)
<br />    I feel fine so far, we might be here a while.
<br />
<br />                JO-JI
<br />        (Excited)
<br />    I hope we are!
<br />EXT. THE FARM - DAY
<br />
<br />Camera again cuts to the sniper. Slowly breathing, taking their time for the shot.
<br />
<br />Camera then cuts to Royce walking in the forrest. Off in the distance he sees the reflection cast off the glass from the other sniper.
<br />
<br />The reflection was so far away that Royce can't distinguish what he is looking at, even when looking down his scope.
<br />
<br />Royce get's down on the ground and begins to aim at the in the direction of the opposing sniper.
<br />
<br />After a few moments of looking, Royce sees the refleciton again and sees that it is a sniper.
<br />
<br />INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY
<br />
<br />                JO-JI (CONT'D)
<br />    You know, I actually watched a man bleed out for two hours once.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    Well, seen as I'll be seeing the light anytime soon, I hope you don't mind me going out with a little bit of honor.
<br />
<br />                JO-JI
<br />    The honor is all yours sugarcup.
<br />INT. DUNNY - DAY
<br />
<br />Camer cuts to Ellis in the bathroom. He stands up off the toilet and does his fly. He washes his hands then picks up his shotgun to leave.
<br />
<br />He goes to open the door but it won't open for him. The camera shows that outside there is a rope attaching his doorhandle to a nearby pole, preventing him from opening the door towards him.
<br />
<br />INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    May I have a cigarette in that case then?
<br />
<br />                JO-JI
<br />    Why you certainly may. It'll probably
<br />
<br />                JO-JI (CONT'D)
<br />    speed up the process.
<br />
<br />Jimmy reaches to his pocket and pulls out his smokes and bends down to light one up.
<br />
<br />EXT. THE FARM - DAY
<br />
<br />By bending down, Jimmy ruins the shot for the sniper aiming at him; the sniper had their finger on the trigger but once again takes it off as they do not have the shot.
<br />
<br />Royce is struggeling to see who he is aiming at as his gun is not meant for such range. He too, is struggeling to get a shot.
<br />
<br />INT. DUNNY - DAY
<br />
<br />Ellis is vigorously trying to open the door in the bathroom.
<br />
<br />INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY
<br />
<br />Jimmy hears this and looks over his shoulder to the bathroom.
<br />
<br />                JO-JI (CONT'D)
<br />    Your friend isn't coming.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    I wasn't expecting him anyways.
<br />
<br />                JO-JI
<br />    Good, cause he definetly wasn't coming.
<br />
<br />Camera begins to zoom in on both camera, moving closer in each time they talk.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    What made you like this?
<br />
<br />                JO-JI
<br />    Bad men make for a bad woman.
<br />
<br />                JIMMY
<br />    There some bad men in your life before all this Jo?
<br />
<br />                JO-JI
<br />    Plenty of them.
<br />
<br />Silence. The camera alternates between all four people in the big unknown standoff. Jo is smiling at Jimmy as she points her gun at him.
<br />
<br />The camera has a close up of the eyes of the four people in the standoff.
<br />
<br />This pause and silence is drawn out for a few seconds, see how long it is possible to draw this out.
<br />
<br />EXT. THE FARM - DAY
<br />
<br />The sniper shoots. The bullet piercesthrough the window through the...
<br />
<br />INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY
<br />
<br />...neck of Jimmy. Blood squirts out of the bullet wound has Jimmy chokes loudly.
<br />
<br />In reaction he fires his gun underneath the table into the stomach of Jo-Ji.
<br />
<br />She screams in pain, stands up in her place and unlaods her gun into the head of Jimmy.
<br />
<br />EXT. THE FARM - DAY
<br />
<br />Royce sees the flash from the barrel of the sniper, camera shows him opening his other eye for a moment before winking to aim once more.
<br />
<br />The sniper stands up and picks up their gun. Just then a bullet pierces through their chest and they hit the ground.
<br />
<br />Blood is splattered all over from the bullet.
<br />
<br />INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY
<br />
<br />In all this chaos, Jo-Ji walks around the table towards the door.
<br />
<br />INT. DUNNY - DAY
<br />
<br />Sick of struggeling with the door, Ellis shoots the handle with his shotgun and walks out.
<br />
<br />EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY
<br />
<br />Jo-Ji walks out at the same time and sees Ellis.
<br />
<br />She throws a knife she had on her side quickly at Ellis. The camera does a quick pan across to see it land in the chest of Ellis.
<br />
<br />As he falls, he fires his shotgun, killing Jo-Ji.
<br />
<br />EXT. THE FARM - DAY
<br />
<br />Royce is now all alone. He gets up and dusts off the dirt from the ground. He picks up his rifle and looks out over the distance.
<br />
<br />He continues to sit still and wait. It is important to note that he is unaware of the death of his companions... he is unaware that he is alone.
<br />
<br />Allow time to pass and allow the audience to feel the lonliness that Royce is experiencing as he sits alone in the trees.
<br />
<br />Again he looks out onto the land at the bottom of the hill.
<br />
<br />Three cars are driving in on the dirt road towards the house.
<br />
<br />He sees the car in the paddock left by the first gunman he shot. The camera pans from the car to the dead gunman from earlier. He makes his way down the hill.
<br />
<br />Once he reaches the bottom there is the river that he has to cross. He jumps in and swims. He hears voices coming from the bank up ahead and pauses to see where they are. He makes it to the other side of the river onto the bank.
<br />
<br />He moves slowly so as to not attract attention. He makes it up the river bank into a paddock. He crawls through a fence.
<br />
<br />With the house some distance away, he starts running towards the car. The camera follows him this whole time. The camera sees the house while he is running and sees the men in and around the house.
<br />
<br />He makes it to the car and finds that it is locked. He looks over to the dead body. He quickly runs the 100 or so meters to the body where he searches for the keys. He finds both the keys and a mobile phone. He takes both and runs back to the car.
<br />
<br />This whole time he has had the bag on his back. He opens the car door, puts the bag in the back seat and starts the car, he drives and makes it out unscathed.
<br />
<br />INT. MOGUL'S HOUSE - EVENING
<br />
<br />Roxanne is sitting in the office alone with a desk lamp on. She is smoking a cigarette while she waits for Royce to come. She is angst in anticipation and anxiety fills her.
<br />
<br />On her face we see a blank expression. She remains strong and does not show sign of defeat, or worse of, sign of emotion.
<br />
<br />We see the glow of the cigarette emphasised. We slowly zoom in on her face. Right until the camera is at a close up of her eyes.
<br />
<br />The camera focuses on the detail in her eyes and sees the colour and patterns in her eyes. It then changes focus and sees the lamp in the reflection of her eyes.
<br />
<br />Camera cuts so that it is at the other end of the room looking at Roxanne in the darkness with only a small amount of light falling on her.
<br />
<br />The purpose of this shot is to show how alone she is at this moment.
<br />
<br />She stands up, walks over to a vinyl collection and picks one. She then walks over to the record player and begins to play the song.
<br />
<br />The song is "Fool Song" by Georgie Jones. She stands back from the record player as she sways to the song. The camera slowly pans around to see a figure in the doorway. Only a silouhette of a character though.
<br />
<br />The man in the doorway slowly walks over to Roxanne. The camera slowly pans down so that it can't see the heads of neither character.
<br />
<br />The man reaches Roxanne and puts his arms around her stomach from behind her. She turns to face who it his.
<br />
<br />Camera cuts to an exteme close up of the two as the look at each other in their grasps. It is Mogul holding Roxanne.
<br />
<br />                MOGUL
<br />    May I have this dance?
<br />
<br />She nods and the two begin to slow dance. This happens for some time as the camera slowl zooms out from the couple in the dark room.
<br />
<br />The zooming out of the camera shows how big the room is and how little space the couple takes up while they dance.
<br />
<br />The camera changes back to a mdeium shot of the two of them. A gunshot is heard. We see a close up of Mogul's face. He is surprised and clearly in pain. He slowly falls to his knees, grasping onto Roxanne as he does so.
<br />
<br />He hits the ground and clutches his stomach; the area of the wound. Roxanne stays in the room for a moment and takes the record off the.
<br />
<br />She slowly exits the room and walks out onto the varandah waiting for Royce.
<br />
<br />EXT. MOGUL'S HOUSE - EVENING
<br />
<br />She waits there for a few moments and lights up a cigarette. there is complete silence except for the burn of the cigarette as she inhales.
<br />
<br />She sits there on the steps of the house and the camera circles around her showing no sign of Royce.
<br />
<br />She looks out onto the street. Takes on last puff and throws the cigarette into the garden. She gets up and walks back into the house down the hallway into the kitchen.
<br />
<br />INT. MOGUL'S HOUSE - EVENING
<br />
<br />The camera cuts to the body of Mogul. He is still alive. He pulls out a gun that was in the back of his belt and begins to slowly crawl out of the room.
<br />
<br />Roxanne mixes a drink of whiskey for herself and stands at the kitchen Bench. She stands in wonder as she comes to terms with everything that has just happened. She notices some blood on her shirt and does nothing about it. She returns to her drink.
<br />
<br />Her attention changes from her drink to the book sitting on the dining table; 
<br />The Old Man and the Sea.
<br />Mogul is seen slowly dragging himself down the hallway.
<br />
<br />EXT. MOGUL'S HOUSE - EVENING
<br />
<br />Camera cuts to see Jimmy pull up and park the car. He remains seated and lights up a cigarette in the car as he waits for Roxanne to come out.
<br />
<br />INT. MOGUL'S OFFICE - EVENING
<br />
<br />Roxanne is transfixed on the cover of the book next to the book she is holding the gun she used to shoot Mogul.
<br />
<br />She hears a noise and turns her head to see what it is.
<br />
<br />EXT. MOGUL'S HOUSE - EVENING
<br />
<br />Camera cuts to Jimmy outside sitting in the car. He hears the sound of a gunshot and is scared by it. As shock enters him he grabs a gun and rushes out of the car.
<br />
<br />The camera follows him as he journeys up the stairs and through the door.
<br />
<br />INT. MOGUL'S HOUSE - EVENING
<br />
<br />He runs all the way down the hallway and stops at the end to see what has happened. The camera is behind him no able to see what has happened.
